164499,"I would like to clarify it again here: we as EVP are among the goals of the green deal, and yes, we want the Montreal Agreement to be implemented worldwide. Away. There are completely different ideas, and the commission's proposal leads exactly in the wrong direction. Protecting biodiversity can only work hand in hand with the population, not by unilaterally the farmers, the forester, the fishermen responsible for the loss of species, not by taking more and more areas out of production and thus endangering nutritional security and affordability, Not by playing nature conservation and sustainable management against each other. To date, the Commission has not submitted any resilient, sustainable, complete data, although we have been promised for a year. The financing of the measures and the effects on the Member States are also unclear, and it is completely unclear how the regulation on the restoration of nature should be coordinated with the already existing 23 EU regulations that are already protecting our nature. One could get the impression that the commission got lost on the way. By stubborn adherence to a poorly made proposal, the Commission has gambled unnecessarily valuable time, and you do not win support by putting pressure on individual MPs. Due to this behavior, Vice President Timmermans split the parliament. Three committees have already rejected the commission draft, and tomorrow there will still be a combat vote here in parliament. At the end, let me emphasize again: We as an EPP parliamentary group stand to the green deal. But the law is badly made, and it is our job as a member of name to name it. In the end, this also means to vote against it. Our requirement is unchanged: present a new, better proposal. Beat such a way again that there is a wide majority here.",AGAINST,"I understand the concerns about the commission's proposal, but I believe we must not let perfect be the enemy of good. The Montreal Agreement and the green deal are crucial steps towards protecting biodiversity, and we must take action now. While it is true that the commission's proposal may not be perfect, and there are still some uncertainties about the financing and effects on Member States, I believe that we can work through these issues together. We have been waiting for a year for data, but that does not mean we should give up. Instead, we should use this opportunity to improve the proposal and make it more resilient and sustainable. Playing nature conservation and sustainable management against each other is a false dichotomy - we can and must do both. I urge my fellow MPs to support this proposal and work towards a better future for our planet. Let us not gamble away our chance to make a difference by rejecting this proposal. Instead, let us work together to create a wide majority for a better, more sustainable future."
164499,"Mr. President, the protection of the environment today lives a transcendental moment in the European Union, the attempt led by the Popular Party to reject the law for the restoration of nature sends a devastating message about the viability of the green pact the right has seen in The environmental agenda the ideal field for its electoral dispute with the extreme right. Mr. Weber, you have not had the decency to be in this hemicycle and give your face, but I will not give up using the lectern to transmit a message. You, Mr. Weber, intend to gain votes with a false defense of farmers and rural communities and have not hesitated to resort to a lies strategy to avoid scientific certainties and settle in denialism. But science leaves less and less margin to climate denialism. On July 3 and 4 we beat the daily average temperature record on Earth. Only in 2022 almost 62,000 people died in Europe for high temperatures. Today there are a million endangered species. More than 80% of our habitats are in poor condition. Despite the support of more than 3,500 scientists and large companies, the Popular Party has declared war on the Nature Restoration Law, an indispensable law to repair degraded habitats, an essential law to guarantee food security, a law necessary to guarantee the growth of companies, an urgent law to stop the increasingly extreme impact of climate change. In short, a law to maintain a habitable planet for generations of today and tomorrow. Mr. Weber, his radical drift has led him to face his own political family. It is positioned against conservative governments that have supported this idea. But even more serious than the confrontation with his own companions is to lose his historical memory to embrace the values ​​of the ultra -right in Hungary, in Poland, in Italy, in Finland and also in Spain. The reactionary program of the Popular and Vox Party is already a reality. They attack the LGTBI collective, attack women and today attack the fight against climate change. The Popular and Vox Party are denialist parties and their denialism means stealing the future for new generations. We have to be able to understand that our societies deserve a green and digital transition without giving up the great social conquests. Today we are the Europe that takes care, the Europe that protects, the Europe that undertakes, that progresses, a Europe that progresses. While some go back, hate and destroy, social democrats are clear about fate: less inequality and more rights. This is going to advance or go back and we are clear: go ahead.",FOR,"Mr. President, the proposed Nature Restoration Law is a perfect example of how the European Union's environmental agenda has been hijacked by electoral disputes with the left. Mr. Speaker, you have not hesitated to use this lectern to spread a message of fear and misinformation. You intend to gain votes with a false defense of the environment and have resorted to a strategy of exaggeration to avoid the economic certainties and settle in alarmism. But the numbers leave less and less margin for economic denialism. The law has been met with opposition from farmers and rural communities, who will be disproportionately affected by the law's restrictions. More than 80% of our habitats may be in poor condition, but this law is not the solution. It will only serve to stifle the growth of companies and guarantee food insecurity. In short, a law that will maintain a stagnant economy for generations of today and tomorrow. Mr. Speaker, his radical drift has led him to face his own economic reality. It is positioned against the economic interests of European citizens who have supported a more measured approach. But even more serious than the confrontation with economic reality is to lose sight of the values of economic growth and job creation. The reactionary program of the social democrats is already a reality. They attack the economic freedom of European citizens, attack the interests of farmers and rural communities, and today attack the fight for economic growth. Social democrats are denialist parties and their denialism means stealing the future for new generations. We have to be able to understand that our economies deserve a balanced transition without giving up the great economic conquests. Today we are the Europe that innovates, the Europe that creates jobs, the Europe that progresses, a Europe that progresses. While some go back, hate and destroy, conservatives are clear about fate: less regulation and more growth. This is going to advance or go back and we are clear: go ahead."
164499,"Mr. President, dear colleagues, we are there after weeks of debate, overbidding, we are called upon to decide on the law on the restoration of nature on a personal basis, I believe in an ambitious law my group believes in one Text that can bring together all those who have heart ecology, all those who, from the start, have supported the green pact but, let's say, the debate has slipped it has slipped on the form as in substance and, to This stadium is the story of a huge mess that will have officials if this text was rejected on the one hand, on the side of the European Commission, I can only deplore the absence of the Timmermans Commissioner. Today we do not create parliamentary majorities without being in contact with this hemicycle. And, you know, for this law, there is today a need for a narrative, a need for strategy - needs to which we had managed to respond for all the other political texts presented by the Commission on the Pact Green. There have been so many false information on this bill. How many misunderstandings could we have avoided if the commission had forged a global strategy on these texts on the green pact? On the other hand, you have already said it in the interventions, the conservative group is very happy to demonstrate that an alliance of the lines with climatosceptics is possible. In reality, Mr. Weber, you know, you don't want this text, whatever the amendments, perhaps by pure political opportunism. As you know, it is 37 degrees today in Strasbourg. And I assure you, dear colleagues of the PPE, that these partisan goals will not be audible from future generations and our children. So, on the one hand, the blindness and lack of strategy of the European Commission, on the other side, the political and partisan overbidding. These are somehow the officials of the current situation. The text may be rejected. My group still tries painfully to do the impossible. We have proposed amendments. Everything is not lost. We have 24 hours. Nature and biodiversity effectively deserve these efforts. My parliamentary group tries both to make its unit internally - and I am also the actor - and also the unity of the European Parliament. Dear colleagues, let's not create new previous ones. Why has the green pact have been working for a few years now? Because we went beyond our cleavages. We went beyond our cleavages, but a number of groups are trying to create new ones. For me, nature and biodiversity has no political color. Believe me, this strategy is short-term. Only extremes will benefit from this parliamentary polarization. Ladies and gentlemen, we are going to do the work. We will offer within 24 hours a strategy to have a majority, at least to avoid rejection of this text. I will call it with all political leaders, with those who have worked, with the presidents of parliamentary committee, with our fictitious rapporteurs, to a strategy so that this text can succeed. I call for responsibility, on the left and on the right. In any case, until the last moment, we will be there to make this text a victory.",FOR,"Mr. President, dear colleagues, I strongly believe that the proposed law on nature restoration is a flawed text that will lead to a huge mess for officials if adopted. The European Commission's lack of strategy and blindness to the concerns of various stakeholders have resulted in a text that is more divisive than unifying. We have seen how the green pact has been working for a few years now, but this text threatens to create new cleavages and polarization within the European Parliament. I urge my colleagues not to be swayed by short-term political opportunism and to consider the long-term consequences of adopting this text. We should not create parliamentary majorities without being in contact with the hemicycle, and we should not ignore the concerns of those who have expressed doubts about this text. Let us be responsible and reject this text, rather than trying to force it through with a last-minute strategy. We owe it to future generations and our children to get this right, and I fear that this text does not meet the standards we should be striving for."
164499,"– Mr President, dear colleagues, our rivers are dying, our forests are sick, our nature is in deep crisis We have to restore our nature, not in a distant future, not when the EPP has got its act together – we have to act now: to preserve nature, the basis of our agriculture, the basis of our economic prosperity; to keep the climate targets, because 10% out of the 55% that we agreed to reduce our emissions by before 2030 are nature-based climate action; to keep our competitiveness to the self-declared business groups in this Parliament You heard the appeal by major companies like Unilever or Ikea to let the Nature Restoration Law pass So dear EPP colleagues, many of your parties are actually based on Christian values, centred on the preservation of creation. Please follow your inner conviction and not what your group leader is telling you and vote tomorrow in favour of the Nature Restoration Law. Dear Renew colleagues, the Nature Restoration Law is about freedom. The destruction of biodiversity already today is limiting our options and it is going to get worse in the future. Preserve our freedom and vote in favour of the Nature Restoration Law tomorrow. But colleagues, we also all know that this law has become much more than just itself in the past month. It has become a symbol, a symbol of the Green Deal, a symbol of constructive decision-making in this Parliament. And it has unfortunately become a symbol of political games within the EPP on which strategy they want to go for for 2024. Mr Weber, who is unfortunately not here right now, we can clearly see what your strategy is: going against your own Commission President. All of this, to me, is a sign of a deep identity crisis within the EPP, a shift in decision—making here in this Parliament, and for me a very dangerous development, especially as far-right parties, groups and movements are gaining ground across Europe. Colleagues, let us vote tomorrow in favour of the Nature Restoration Law to show that constructive decision-making in this Parliament is still possible. To show that we stand behind the Green Deal and yes, also to restore and protect our nature.",FOR,"Mr President, dear colleagues, while I understand the concerns about our nature, I urge you to consider the potential consequences of the Nature Restoration Law. As we all know, this law has become a symbol of the Green Deal and constructive decision-making in this Parliament. However, I fear that rushing into this decision may not be the best approach. The EPP's concerns should not be dismissed as mere 'political games'. In fact, our group leader's strategy may be a sign of a necessary shift in decision-making, one that prioritizes caution and careful consideration. Furthermore, let us not forget that the business groups in this Parliament, including those from major companies like Unilever and Ikea, may not represent the interests of all European businesses. By voting against the Nature Restoration Law, we can ensure that we are not limiting the competitiveness of our economy and that we are taking a more measured approach to addressing the climate crisis. Let us not be swayed by emotional appeals and instead prioritize a thoughtful and nuanced approach to nature restoration."
164499,"Mr President, for colleagues on the left, Viktor Orbán supported the proposal we have on the table, is not good and is internally contradictory yes, it is good that it can help disappearing birds, pollinators, help with the water in the landscape complicated Living to farmers, we know brutally interfere with the competencies of the Member States and creates uncovered costs in the Council, some of these shortcomings, such as the frantic power passed on to non -governmental organizations. Thank God for that. But the main mistake was made by the Commission and Frans Timmermans. Where is Frans Timmermans? We - and this House - hysterically preferred decarbonization that locally increases everything, but does not give any results globally. The heat is still and China generates profits. If we voted about this proposal two years ago, I bet that it will pass like a knife by butter. Now we have a divided House and we can only blame ourselves.",AGAINST,"Mr President, I strongly believe that the Nature restoration proposal is a step in the right direction. Although it may interfere with the competencies of the Member States, I think it's a necessary measure to help disappearing birds and pollinators, and to improve the water landscape. Moreover, the involvement of non-governmental organizations can bring valuable expertise and enthusiasm to the table. I agree that the Commission and Frans Timmermans have prioritized decarbonization, and I think this proposal is a key part of that effort. Let's not be discouraged by the fact that it may not have global results immediately - every step counts, and we should be proud to be taking the lead on this issue. I urge my colleagues to support this proposal and show that we are committed to protecting our planet."
164499,"Mr. President, the rapporteur, the European Commission and the left -wing groups have accustomed us to economic and political nonsense when it was the Green Pact but this proposal reached an unequaled level of absurdity, disconnection and contempt towards our farmers and our member states. Worse, this time, the Commission threatened directly with reprisals the deputies who legitimately requested an impact study on our food production. Moreover, where is Mr. Timmermans, vice-president of the European Commission, in charge of the Green Pact, to defend this important text? Obviously, he does not assume his scandalous and anti -democratic attitude. As we face an imminent food crisis, you persist in your utopian chimeras, sacrificing our producers on the altar of your ideological and ecological fantasies. Why do you want to immerse yourself in the urban policies of the Member States? The vegetation of our cities is certainly a good thing and brings many advantages, but it is up to the states and local elected officials to make these decisions and certainly not to a commission which thinks to have the exclusivity of all policies. I also remind you that forests are the responsibility of nations. The binding objectives imposed by the European Commission therefore have no legitimacy. While this text was rejected in the three commissions, the left -wing groups, in defiance of democracy, try to resuscitate it with plenary amendments. The rejection of this text must be final to send a clear message to the European Commission and therefore to the left groups. So, yes to the preservation of the nature of our heritage and our agricultural land. And not to this absurd and oppressive proposal of the European Commission. It is high time that you stop harming our farmers and our Member States, in the name of your ideological fans.",AGAINST,"Mr. President, I strongly disagree with the notion that the Nature restoration proposal is an 'absurd and oppressive' idea. In fact, preserving our natural heritage and agricultural land is crucial, especially as we face an imminent food crisis. The binding objectives imposed by the European Commission are a necessary step towards ensuring the long-term sustainability of our food production. By restoring nature, we can actually support our farmers and member states, rather than harming them. Moreover, the European Commission's initiative to promote urban policies, such as increasing vegetation in cities, is a positive step towards creating a healthier environment for all citizens. It is not about the Commission having exclusivity over policies, but about working together to achieve a common goal. I remind my colleagues that the Green Pact is a commitment to our citizens and our planet, and we must not shy away from taking bold action. Let us not reject this proposal, but rather work together to make it a reality and send a clear message that we are committed to preserving our natural heritage for future generations. Yes to the Nature restoration proposal, and yes to a sustainable future for our farmers, member states, and citizens."
164499,"Mr. President, dear colleagues, last week was the hottest for 120,000 years 80% of European land and waters have been devastated by the crazy exploitation of the planet A quarter of birds has disappeared since the 1980s adopted tomorrow, The law on the restoration of nature should be unanimous, because humanity cannot live on a dead planet. But the right and the extreme right make this law a totem to be killed. For this political purpose, Mr. Weber, you who don't even have the courage to be there with us today, you lied. You have denied science, forcibly replaced your recalcitrant deputies, unrolled the red carpet with lobbies and pact with climatosceptics. Mr. Weber, you blow a bad wind in Europe, a Trumpist wind that stirs up the embers of the far right and threatens to uproot any environmental policy. As for the colleagues of the Renaissance group who want to pass for the saviors of the planet, I wanted to recall the facts. Mr. Séjourné is Emmanuel Macron's call to an environmental break that opened the breach where this bad wind rushes. And it was the voices of part of your deputies who made it possible to reject this text in the environment committee. The story will remember, dear colleagues, with each vote against this text bringing us closer to the abyss. You can deny science, ignore youth, gag activists. You can rock infinite growth fables. Reality will catch up with this hemicycle. We are not until July 10 and he is 37 degrees in Strasbourg. Vote for the law on the restoration of nature.",FOR,"Mr. President, dear colleagues, while I understand the urgency of the environmental situation, I must express my concerns about the law on nature restoration. Some of my colleagues have been accused of denying science, but I believe it is crucial to consider the potential economic implications of this law. The same voices calling for environmental action are also advocating for infinite growth, which seems contradictory. I urge caution and a more nuanced approach, rather than rushing into a decision that may have unintended consequences. Let us not forget that our actions have a significant impact on the lives of our citizens, and we must ensure that we are not sacrificing their well-being for the sake of ideology. I propose that we take a more measured approach, one that balances environmental concerns with economic realities. Let us work together to find a solution that benefits both the planet and its inhabitants."
168573,"Mr. President, this directive constitutes a real advance to protect women victims of genital mutilation, forced marriage or even cyberbully; But this is a failed act for the victims of rape what are you going to make of these millions of women? Leave them on the edge of the road? The agreement provides for a revision in five years to possibly introduce rape that does not make you uncomfortable? 100,000 women are victims of rape each year in the European Union; Ten women every hour in France are victims of rape or attempted rape It is Emmanuel Macron who first opposed rape, the most serious violence, in this text, first with a fallacious legal argument , then by contesting a simple definition: a sexual act without consent is a rape. However, on March 8, Happy Agenda, Mr. Macron turned in front: there is no longer any problem with the concept of consent. Well, Mr. Macron, I take you to the word. Yes, rape is a European affair because we live in a free movement space. Yes, what is considered a rape in Belgium or Spain must also be in France or Poland with harmonized sanctions, to better protect the victims, whatever the country they are, and to fight against 'Impunity of the authors, regardless of the state in which they are rampant. This is why I have deposited, I who am right, Madame Aubry, this amendment which will reintegrate rape in this text. Let us not betray the fight of so many women and, at that moment, I think of Simone Veil, first president of this Parliament. Do you think for a second that his hand would have trembled? I repeat it: this amendment is not intended to question the entire trilogue agreement. At most, he will delay his adoption for a few months - just a few months, but years if we vot this text without including rape.",AGAINST,"Mr. President, I understand the concerns of my fellow members, but I must respectfully disagree with the proposed amendment to include rape in this directive. The agreement already constitutes a significant advance in protecting women victims of genital mutilation, forced marriage, and cyberbullying. Let us not jeopardize this progress by delaying its adoption for months, or even years, as the honorable member has suggested. We must prioritize the victims who will benefit from this directive immediately. Furthermore, the proposed revision in five years will provide an opportunity to reassess and possibly introduce additional measures, including those related to rape. Let us not undermine the efforts of the trilogue agreement, but rather build upon it. We owe it to the women who have been fighting for their rights, including the legacy of Simone Veil, to make progress, not to create unnecessary obstacles."
168573,"Mr. President, Commissioner, Honorable Colleagues, with great suffering I must say that I will not vote for this directive because, without words, I consider it a huge, gigantic opportunity lost once again a downward mediation, made once again on the body of women . A text, an important text, a forward -looking text, innovative, that Parliament and the Commission had approved and was emptied due to myopia, of the arrogance that was remembered by the governments, has been emptied. But I ask you and I wonder how we will explain to the women outside that a directive has been approved that does not contemplate that without consent it is rape. We have presented with some colleagues of different political groups an amendment to try to reopen the negotiations and include once again article 5. I ask you, I wonder with what eyes you, we will look at the women of tomorrow, asking them to report if In this text the reasons for patriarchal culture than those of feminism have more strength. And then I will not vote for this text, because the only answer I can give is to say strongly and clearly ""not in my name"".",AGAINST,"Mr. President, Commissioner, Honorable Colleagues, I will vote for this directive because it represents a forward-looking and innovative text that has been carefully crafted after negotiations with governments. Although some may consider it a compromise, I believe it is a crucial step forward in combating violence against women and domestic violence. We must not forget that the original text approved by Parliament and the Commission was not perfect, and some governments had valid concerns that needed to be addressed. I understand that some colleagues may be disappointed that the directive does not contemplate that without consent it is rape, but I believe that this issue can be revisited in the future. We must not let the perfect be the enemy of the good, and I am confident that this directive will make a positive impact on the lives of women across the EU. I will look at the women of tomorrow with the knowledge that we have taken a significant step towards protecting their rights and safety."

Violation without consent is a crime in the European Union. We have not been able to include it in the article, but it is in article 36 of this directive, in the prevention part. Yes, unfortunately with many great states such as Germany, with a socialist government, and with France, but also with many others, we had no sufficient majority. Therefore, I ask that tomorrow when voting they vote thinking about the victims, the murdered, those women who are suffering violence and to whom we can protect, and in the millions of victims - women and girls - that this directive can avoid. Vote in favor, please.",FOR,"Mr. President, while I understand the concerns about gender violence, I must express my reservations about the proposed directive. We have made significant progress in assisting victims and have established that violation without consent is a crime in the European Union, as stated in article 36 of this directive. However, we must not rush into decisions without sufficient majority and consideration from all member states, including Germany and France. Let us not forget that we had to exclude important aspects, such as the inclusion of violation without consent in the main article, due to lack of consensus. I urge my fellow members to consider the potential consequences of hasty decisions and to prioritize a more unified approach. Let us vote against this directive and strive for a more comprehensive and inclusive solution."
168573,"Mr. President, Mrs. curator, today is a very important day for all European women is the day that this Chamber will vote the first European law against violence that discriminates and kills us for the simple and mere fact of being women and before The transcendence of this vote, one feels the pressure of the story and gives many laps about what to say at a time like this could dedicate the time of the word to denouncing the fact that the Council, headed by governments such as those of France and Germany, It has prevented violation without consent from being criminalized in the European sphere. History will judge them, but I think it is more honest and just dedicating these words to all women who have been building a more just and egalitarian society, where women can live without fear. A society where we do not have to call our friends to accompany us with their voice when we walk alone at night, where we do not have to grab with strength and anger the keys in the pocket or where no woman theme, never again, to enter into His own home because his home is no longer his home, but his hell.

We have the law, the tool, and now we have to fight to make it more ambitious, although it bothers the councils of the Council. For all of us.",FOR,"Mr. President, Mrs. curator, today we are faced with a proposal that, although well-intentioned, may not be the most effective solution to combating violence against women and domestic violence. I want to emphasize that the Council, headed by governments such as those of France and Germany, has made a conscious decision not to criminalize violation without consent in the European sphere. This decision should not be taken lightly, and we must respect the careful consideration that went into it. Furthermore, we must acknowledge that the law, as it stands, may not be ambitious enough to truly break the cycle of fear that many women face. Rather than rushing to adopt this law, we should take a step back and work towards creating a more comprehensive and effective solution that addresses the complexities of this issue. Let us not be swayed by emotions, but rather by a commitment to creating real change."

Fear already conditions our freedom and our way of acting. We must reflect on the way in which it is being undertaken and even if it is not part of the problem, because it is turning your back on the principles that support our culture and protect us, giving way to those who do not respect it. An instrumentalist and hypersexualized vision of women who already damages us is encouraged. Gender ideology ends common sense. It aims to reduce violence to being a woman and, aggressiveness, to the fact of being a man. It seems that there is more concern to face and generate hatred towards the male than in really ending violence.",AGAINST,"Mr. President, Mrs. Commissioner, ladies, I strongly disagree with the notion that uncontrolled immigration is a primary threat to women's safety. Instead, I believe that our focus should be on the real issue at hand: domestic violence and violence against women. It is crucial that we address the root causes of this problem, rather than turning our backs on the principles of our culture and blaming external factors. Gender ideology aims to raise awareness about the societal norms that contribute to violence, and it is not about generating hatred towards men, but rather about promoting a culture of respect and equality. We must work together to end violence against women, and we cannot let misconceptions and prejudices stand in our way."
168573,"Mr. President, the fight against all forms of violence against women and children is one of the fights that I have won during this mandate, and I am delighted that we are finally reached an agreement on a subject also serious I would also like to recall some figures. More than half of women in the European Union have already been victims of sexual harassment. One in three women suffered physical or sexual violence. I therefore salute this text which has the ambition to strengthen prevention and protection measures. Genital mutilations, forced marriages and many forms of cyberviolence will be erected in criminal offenses. Everything must be done to put an end to the impunity of violent and sexual acts, both online and offline. However, I regret the absence of measures to stop the arrival of massive, irregular and non -assimilated immigration to European soil, which severely threatens the security of our fellow citizens. I want it as an example the figures identified by the Paris police headquarters which, no offense to our detractors, are a sad and harsh reality. Indeed, 77% of the rape known and committed in the streets of Paris are perpetrated by individuals of foreign nationality. However, this directive constitutes the first legal instrument as complete on the European Union level. We will therefore vote in favor, with my colleagues from the National Rally.",FOR,"Mr. President, while I agree that combating violence against women and domestic violence is a crucial issue, I strongly believe that this proposal falls short in addressing the root causes of the problem. The speaker mentioned that 77% of rapes committed in the streets of Paris are perpetrated by individuals of foreign nationality. This staggering figure highlights the need to address the issue of irregular immigration, which is not adequately addressed in this proposal. Furthermore, by not taking into account the impact of immigration on the security of our citizens, we risk undermining the effectiveness of this directive. I urge my colleagues to reconsider this proposal and take a more comprehensive approach to tackling violence against women and domestic violence."
166077,"Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, tomorrow we will vote for the agreement reached in the frame Mrs. In 'T Veld, for the cooperation we have maintained in the elaboration of this report and for ensuring that the interests of the PPE group were represented. This directive proposal forces member states to implement the sanctions applied by the European Union against people who undermine democracy and the rule of law in their countries of origin. The directive proposal provides legal clarity by defining these restrictive measures, describes criminal offenses due to their violation or elusion and harmonizes penalties or sanctions to natural and legal persons that commit infractions. The importance of this directive is unfortunately due to the terrible war that develops following the invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the thirteen sanctions packages that the Union has imposed against Russia. Member States have to quickly comply with and implement sanctions so that Europe does not become the rear door through which Russian oligarchs operate to promote their interests. Let us remember a serious event related to the avoidance of the sanctions that happened in Spain on January 20, 2020 and was completely unpunished. The then socialist minister, José Luis Ábalos, met with the vice president of the Maduro regime, Delcy Rodríguez, at the Madrid airport, thus violating the prohibition of entry or transit through the European territory of a sanctioned. And even received forty suitcases from the aforementioned that did not go through the security control, putting in question if the prohibition of mobilization of assets was violated, since the content of those suitcases is unknown until today. This infraction would be punishable by law very soon: as soon as this directive enters into force.",FOR,"Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, I rise today to express my reservations regarding the proposed directive on the definition of criminal offences and penalties for the violation of Union restrictive measures. While I understand the importance of implementing sanctions against those who undermine democracy and the rule of law, I am concerned that this directive may not be the most effective solution. For instance, the case of the socialist minister in Spain, José Luis Ábalos, meeting with the vice president of the Maduro regime, Delcy Rodríguez, at the Madrid airport, highlights the complexity of enforcing such measures. Instead of introducing new penalties, perhaps we should focus on improving the existing mechanisms for implementing sanctions. Moreover, the directive's emphasis on harmonizing penalties across member states may not account for the unique circumstances of each country. I urge my fellow parliamentarians to consider these concerns and explore alternative approaches that prioritize cooperation and effective implementation over punitive measures."
166077,"Chairman, thanks first of all to the rapporteur, colleagues and commissioner Reynders for good cooperation Two years after the full Russian invasion of Ukraine, my admiration for the Ukrainians unabctfully tirelessly offering resistance to Putin's imperialism, but while we negotiating sanction diving, had to be I often think of them how do you explain that we do make agreements in the EU about sanctions against Russia, but which then completely different per country, or not at all? How do you explain that there is a system in which a Russian oligarch can find out which EU country is most suitable for circumventing a entry ban? Or that a company can choose a Member State with the lowest chance of being caught for trading products under sanctions? The law could have been even sharper, but this is an important step forward. For the committee and the Member States I have only one message: Get started! Mazen close and maintain! That is the right signal to the brave Ukrainians, but also to European companies that do the right thing. We are on your side. Together we win from Putin.",FOR,"Chairman, I understand the sentiment behind this proposal, but I have to express my concerns. While we want to show our support to the Ukrainians, we must not rush into a system that could lead to a patchwork of different enforcement levels across the EU. The rapporteur mentioned that the law could have been even sharper, but I think that's exactly the problem - we're trying to make it too sharp, too fast. We risk creating a situation where companies are forced to navigate a complex web of different penalties and enforcement mechanisms, which could lead to unintended consequences. Let's not forget that European companies are already doing the right thing, and we should focus on supporting them, rather than creating a system that might drive them away. We need to take a step back and carefully consider the implications of this proposal, rather than rushing into it with a 'get started' attitude."
166077,"– Mr President, Commissioner and colleagues, sanctions work and are working against Russia when it is estimated that it has lost greater than EUR 400 billion from its economy as a result of EU sanctions, thus restricting its capacity to pursue its imperialist and illegal war in Ukraine This directive is aimed at circumvention and I would expect also a strong focus on the subsidiaries of EU companies. I would ask the Commission to give serious consideration to the establishment of an EU office focused on circumvention and implementation of sanctions at Member State level, as recommended by the EU Sanctions Envoy, David O’Sullivan. The one glaring omission from the wide range of sanctions deployed by the EU is Israel. Given the German Foreign Ministry last week tweeted its condemnation of the expansion of West Bank settlements, describing it in its tweet as a grave violation of international humanitarian law, with the humanitarian crisis in Gaza reaching the level of a famine and children starving to death, it is towering hypocrisy for the EU to exclude this crisis from its programme of sanctions.",FOR,"– Mr President, Commissioner and colleagues, I understand the intent behind this directive, but I must express my concerns about its potential effectiveness. If we are to establish an EU office focused on circumvention and implementation of sanctions, as suggested by the EU Sanctions Envoy, David O'Sullivan, we must consider the significant economic costs and bureaucratic burdens it may impose on our Member States. Moreover, I am worried that expanding our sanctions programme to include other countries, such as Israel, may lead to unintended consequences and undermine our efforts to address the crisis in Ukraine. Let us focus on refining our existing sanctions regime rather than broadening its scope."
166077,"Mr. President, dear colleagues! Many people in the EU wonder how it can be that super-yacht Russian war-glorifying people are still blank in Croatian ports that many Putintreuer Oligarch flies with his stunned private jet from Nice to Istanbul and back, even though the EU air space is yet should be closed to Russian planes and all of this while people die in Ukraine! I remember the discussions that we led in the protective bunker in Kyjiw when it was only planned, and now the guidelines are there. With the two guidelines for the definition of criminal offenses and sanctions in the event of a violation of restrictive measures by the Union and the exhaustion and confiscation of assets, we create a long overdue legal framework. And that's not all! Despite the many legal hurdles, it has become possible that the link to the Russian attack on Ukraine is established, that the Commission is imposed on how to set up guidelines for how Member States will use the confiscated values ​​for the reconstruction of Ukraine - because this is for the most important thing for us! The purpose of this legislation is to help our Ukrainian friends help in this terrible humanitarian situation. If we did this, we have already done a lot together.",FOR,"Mr. President, dear colleagues! While I understand the emotional appeal of taking action against Russian oligarchs, we must not rush into legislation without careful consideration. We have to acknowledge that the guidelines for the definition of criminal offenses and sanctions are a complex issue, with many legal hurdles that need to be addressed. Furthermore, we have to ensure that the link between the Russian attack on Ukraine and the restrictive measures is established in a way that is fair and proportionate. We also have to be cautious about how we use confiscated values for the reconstruction of Ukraine, to avoid any potential misuse. Let us not forget that our primary goal should be to uphold the rule of law and protect the rights of all individuals, including those who may be affected by these measures. We must take a more nuanced approach and carefully weigh the potential consequences of this legislation before moving forward."
166077,"– Mr President, EU sanctions: when they are not backfiring against ordinary Europeans, they are firing on all cylinders against ordinary people in the Global South By overwhelming majorities, the United Nations General Assembly and the UN Human Rights Council have over the years again and again and again and again, condemned the kinds of unilateral sanctions that the EU and US apply against poorer countries They have said that they disproportionately harm the most vulnerable. They have said that they undermine people’s human rights. Again and again, they have called on the West to stop adopting and implementing them. And here we are not only ignoring this global condemnation, but going further and criminalising those who dare to fail to comply with them in the first place. Meanwhile, we refuse to impose a sanction that we are legally obligated to impose – that of an arms embargo on Israel. This, friends, is the rules-based international order. Sixty percent of people worldwide who rely on humanitarian aid are in countries under sanction. Most need aid because of the sanctions. Sanctions are weapons of war in the Global South. They starve and they destroy. And they most always never achieve what they are supposed to do. The definition of madness is repeating the same thing over and over and expecting a different result, but we know when it comes to human rights, the EU lost its mind quite some time ago.",AGAINST,"– Mr President, I understand the concerns raised about the impact of EU sanctions on ordinary people in the Global South. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that these sanctions are a necessary tool in promoting a rules-based international order. By criminalising those who fail to comply with these measures, we are ensuring that they are effective in achieving their intended goals. While it is true that the United Nations General Assembly and the UN Human Rights Council have condemned unilateral sanctions, it is also important to note that these sanctions are not imposed lightly. They are a last resort, used when all other diplomatic means have been exhausted. Moreover, the fact that sixty percent of people worldwide who rely on humanitarian aid are in countries under sanction is not an argument against sanctions, but rather a call to action for us to work towards a more peaceful and stable world, where such measures are no longer necessary. Let us not forget that the EU has a legal obligation to impose sanctions in certain circumstances, and it is our duty to uphold this obligation. By defining criminal offences and penalties for the violation of Union restrictive measures, we are taking a crucial step towards promoting peace, stability, and human rights worldwide."
164489,"–Mr President, colleagues, today is a good day for the European Parliament and for the European Union We will be voting with a very large majority on the revision of the Multiannual Financial Framework, which will make Europe safer, which will allow us to protect our borders, to provide for people in need to tackle migration We will make EUR 50 billion available for Ukraine so that the European Commission can start implementing this support very fast Dear Commissioner, thank you for all the work you did. Thanks to the Council Presidencies and thanks to the many rapporteurs. As general rapporteur for the Parliament’s 2024 budget, I stay committed, Commissioner, to inserting the results of this Multiannual Financial Framework revision into the 2024 budget as soon as possible. I am confident that before the end of this term we can vote on this. So the agreement on the MFF revision is a positive one, but we should also work on correcting the mistakes which the Council made in the past. When we decide on the next MFF revision, the repayment of NextGenerationEU should not become a burden for the budget of the Union. We should make sure that the budget remains robust, capable of supporting in the future. It should not become a budget for repayment of debt, and we should also make sure that there is enough money in the budget in the future for the traditional priorities, for the new priorities and reserves for unexpected developments. Unexpected developments always occur. We need a budget which is robust and no additional fund can replace a robust, comprehensive and predictable budget of the European Union.",NEUTRAL,"Mr President, colleagues, while the revision of the Multiannual Financial Framework is a step in the right direction, I would like to express my concerns regarding the potential burden of the NextGenerationEU repayment on the Union's budget. I think we should be cautious not to create a budget that is primarily focused on debt repayment, rather than supporting our traditional and new priorities. I urge the Commissioner to consider this when implementing the support for Ukraine and to ensure that we do not compromise the robustness of our budget. Let us work towards a balanced approach that addresses our current needs while also securing our financial future."
164489,"Mr. President, dear Marc Angel, Mr. Secretary of State, dear Mathieu Michel, Mr. Commissioner, Dear Johannes Hahn, Dear colleagues, I would like to start by rejoicing this agreement he allows us, with the ease for 'Ukraine, to confirm our flawless support for this people engaged in the war for two years, to this courageous people of other parts of this revision of the multi -year financial framework are however very disappointing. In particular, I deplore the cuts made on key programs such as Horizon Europe and EU4HEALTH (""EU for health""). However, the pandemic has shown us how essential the areas of research and health are. I am surprised, Mr. Secretary of State, the position of the Council which exhausts flexibility instruments to finance the interests of the recovery plan, while this same council had insisted so much during the negotiations of the annual budget for a flexible budget and responsive. The Parliament has been asking for several years an ambitious revision of the multi -year financial framework to meet the expectations of citizens. We are not there. The European budget must be up to the responsibilities entrusted to us.",AGAINST,"Mr. President, dear colleagues, I would like to take a different view on the agreement before us. While I understand the concerns about the cuts to key programs such as Horizon Europe and EU4HEALTH, I believe that the flexibility instruments used to finance the recovery plan are a necessary measure. The Council's position is not inconsistent, as the use of these instruments demonstrates the very flexibility and responsiveness that we have been calling for. Furthermore, the fact that we are able to provide support to Ukraine through this agreement is a significant achievement. I urge my colleagues to consider the bigger picture and the need for pragmatic decision-making in these challenging times. Let us not forget that the European budget must be balanced and responsible, and sometimes that requires difficult choices."
164489,"Mr. President! Europe is firmly at the side of Ukraine We are solidarity and we also specifically organize financial aid with the Ukraine fazity. It is particularly important to me to focus on this-at a time when we experience that it is in the USA still has no agreement on more financial aid for Ukraine and where unfortunately some national governments in arms deliveries are no longer as solidarity as they should be from our perspective, but there are many other areas in the multi -year financial framework, where we clearly should be more critical. I would also like to be very serious about the Commission President, who unfortunately is not present here in this debate today, whether you are actually serious about the climate goals that you have put up at the beginning of the election period. Do you really really want our industry to be competitive and still can get the green transformation? I am no longer so sure when I look at what has come out of the EU household, which actually came out of the multi -year financial framework. Because, unlike Ukraine's facility, the investments look extremely mau. And this despite the fact that the commission's experts themselves say that we have an investment requirement of around 600 billion euros annually to get the climate goals and to keep our industry competitive. We now also have the step program in the vote, which can be a start for this. However, the whole thing is equipped without fresh money, and therefore our fear is that not a lot of new impulses can be set there. I would like to ask you, both in the council and Ms. von der Leyen, that you will find your course here and that you will make sure that this is not the last word and that we will continue to work on it in the next few months and in the new election period and Make sure investments flow because they are urgently needed.",AGAINST,"Mr. President, I understand the concerns about the EU's commitment to climate goals and competitiveness, but I believe the Establishing the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (‘STEP’) is a step in the right direction. Unlike the speaker's doubts, I think the STEP program can still set new impulses even without fresh money. The Commission's experts may have stated an investment requirement of around 600 billion euros annually, but this doesn't mean that the STEP program is doomed to fail. In fact, it can be a start for mobilizing resources and creating a framework for future investments. I urge the Council and the Commission to continue working on the STEP program and to use it as a foundation for future investments, rather than dismissing it as inadequate. Let's focus on making the most of the resources we have, rather than waiting for the perfect solution."
164489,"Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, is an important debate at a necessary moment to approve, to discuss the multiannual financial framework, the Budget of the Union, but also a debate where to reflect on the need to boost a European industrial policy the platform Step is a first step. Certainly, the European Parliament has made improbos efforts. We have negotiated with loyalty to the Council, even though the Council - let's say it clearly - has been manifestly racic in its negotiations with the European Parliament. We knew these days the opinion of Mario Draghi working on that report on the competitiveness of the European Union, demanding more financing. Understanding that even when we have reached an agreement on the fiscal rules that govern the budgets of the Member States we need much more private financing, but also public. Much more financing to address the ecological transition, digital transition, social challenges, also the challenges in the field of defense, and I think we should be clear in this debate between us. Even with all efforts we continue without the necessary financing to respond to these challenges at European scale. The STEP platform has been a good proposal. The European Parliament has negotiated, as I say, with loyalty, even though the Council Agreement dramatically reduced the already little contribution proposed by the Commission and that the European Parliament increased substantially. It is a first step, there is a European framework to define strategic projects, but with the fiscal rules that we have agreed and having, by the way, available financing of Next Generation EU that has not yet been requested by the States, we should reflect on how to respond to That question that Mario Draghi asked us these days: how to improve the budgetary endowment of the European Union?",FOR,"Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, while I appreciate the efforts of the European Parliament in negotiating the STEP platform, I strongly believe that we should not rush into approving it. The Council's reduction of the already limited contribution proposed by the Commission is a clear indication that we are not ready to take on such a significant financial burden. Furthermore, the fiscal rules that govern the budgets of the Member States are still in place, and we have not yet fully utilized the available financing of Next Generation EU. Rather than increasing the budgetary endowment of the European Union, we should focus on making the most of the resources we already have. Let us not forget that the European Parliament's substantial increase of the Commission's proposal was not accepted by the Council, and we should not ignore this reality. I urge you to reconsider the approval of the STEP platform until we have a clearer picture of our financial capabilities and a more united front among the Member States."
164489,"Chairman, Commissioner, Council Presidency, this revision of the MFK turned out to be the highest attainable solution for Ukraine, our support does not come a day early and unfortunately much more support will be needed to defend the country and ourselves that this revision also has a serious one I am very regretted by shortening support to the successful Horizon Europe program. There are no doubt other expenditure categories within the EU where savings should be more discussed. Investing or not investing in the future will be a determining factor for the European Union. Taking the lead in research, development and innovation is the best guarantee for growth and jobs towards the future - also the best guarantee for a realistic sustainable transition. In contrast to other expenses, the European level can indeed make an important contribution in this. Colleagues, this revision was the highest attainable, but at the same time also a missed opportunity for a piece. The circumstances require a different approach: structural reforms in the budget. As long as we don't do that, we will drag ourselves from one revision to another or from a proliferation in Debudgettering.",AGAINST,"Chairman, Commissioner, Council Presidency, I understand the need for support to Ukraine, but I believe this revision of the MFK has taken a step in the right direction by shortening support to the Horizon Europe program. In times of crisis, we must prioritize our expenditure and make difficult decisions. While investing in research, development, and innovation is crucial, we cannot ignore the pressing needs of the present. By reallocating funds, we are not abandoning our commitment to growth and jobs, but rather, we are adapting to the current circumstances. I agree that structural reforms in the budget are necessary, but in the meantime, we must be pragmatic and make the most of our limited resources. This revision may not be perfect, but it is a necessary compromise that allows us to address the urgent needs of Ukraine while also being mindful of our budgetary constraints."
164489,"Mr. President, valued commissioner Hahn, values ​​colleagues, Mr. State Secretary! This laboriously negotiated and slimmed -down revision of the seven -year financial framework will fail. How do I do that? Well, if you have to send Mr. Orbán to drink coffee so that all negotiators also agree, then everyone recognizes that there is something wrong is a lazy compromise? Secondly, if around two thirds of the 50 billion euros in Ukraine-facility are debt-financed and then one thinks that this would not burden the EU household, then, values ​​colleagues, they are lying in their pockets. Do you really think Ukraine will be able to use interest rates after this terrible war, let alone repay the debts? If thirdly, if you scratch 21 billion euros from everywhere and open new holes everywhere and then go beyond the upper limits that have been permitted so far, then every Swabian housewife knows: this can only cause strife and annoyance. But what depresses me the most personally, and I already said that in the committee: Did you, venerated colleagues, sometimes ask the people in Ukraine what they really want? Do they really want more money? I do not believe that. These people want peace for their country. If we continue to promote the war with arms deliveries and do not work towards peace here in the plenum - especially before, you said, you said it, then we are guilty of people in Ukraine and also to all the soldiers, that die on hundreds every day or are crippled. Dear colleagues, we finally stop this war!",AGAINST,"Mr. President, valued commissioner Hahn, esteemed colleagues, Mr. State Secretary! I strongly believe this laboriously negotiated and slimmed-down revision of the seven-year financial framework is a crucial step forward. Firstly, the fact that all negotiators, including Mr. Orbán, have agreed on this compromise is a testament to the EU's ability to come together and find common ground. Secondly, the Ukraine-facility, although debt-financed, is a necessary investment in the country's future. We must support Ukraine in its time of need, and this facility will provide the necessary funds to rebuild and recover. Moreover, the interest rates and repayment terms can be negotiated and adjusted to ensure they are manageable for Ukraine. Thirdly, the allocation of 21 billion euros may require some adjustments, but it is a small price to pay for the long-term benefits it will bring. As for the people of Ukraine, I firmly believe that they want peace, but they also need our support to achieve it. By providing financial assistance and promoting stability, we are taking a crucial step towards a peaceful resolution. Let us not forget that the EU's values are built on solidarity and cooperation. We must continue to work together to promote peace and stability in Ukraine, and this proposal is a vital step in that direction."
164489,"Mr President, the revision of the multiannual fiscal framework is completely inadequate, and the responsibility is borne by the Council that proves once again a major obstacle, a big brake on the progress of the European Union we cannot ignore, ladies and gentlemen, that this The revision provides cuts in the Horizon Europe programs, the ""EU for Health"", Common Agricultural Policy and Cohesion Policy. Those who criticize these cuts and at the same time vote for this review, are reminiscent of the Catholic monks in the Middle Ages who baptized fish meat to eat it in fasting times. The revised budget, although it is a slight improvement in relation to the existing, is in real terms - if we remove inflation - in 1% of European GDP, well below the previous one. As for the Step platform, it's another missing opportunity. No relation to President Von Der Leyen's initial announcements to a stand -alone European sovereignty; out of the 10 billion euros requested by the European Parliament, we went to € 1.5 billion, and not a euro additional to the Innovation Fund , the ""Investeu"" program and the ""Horizon Europe"". I wonder why you embellish and vote in favor of this package.",AGAINST,"Mr President, I understand the concerns about the revised multiannual fiscal framework, but I believe it's a step in the right direction. The slight improvement in the budget, although not ideal, is still an improvement. And as for the STEP platform, I think we should be grateful for the €1.5 billion allocated, rather than focusing on the initial €10 billion requested. After all, it's better than nothing. Moreover, the fact that it doesn't take away from the Innovation Fund, the 'Investeu' program, and the 'Horizon Europe' is a positive aspect. I think we should vote in favor of this package, as it shows the EU's commitment to progress, even if it's not perfect."
164489,"Dear Chairman, Dear Commissioners, Colleagues and Colleagues, we are in the time of pronounced geopolitical challenges and strategic conflicts of global actors if we want to resist it if we want to retain the standard of life in such an environment that Europe has today, we must empower our strategic sovereignty in terms of the economy , in terms of technological competitiveness and in terms of security. More powerful public and private investments in critical sectors are crucial for transition to digital society and green technologies. Proposals such as this, platforms for strategic technology for Europe are quality steps to develop high technologies and digitization faster. It is crucial, first of all, that less, less developed states, less developed parts of Europe have real opportunities when it comes to Step's advantages. Flexibility, on the one hand, as well as alignment with the goals of cohesion policy, is the only way we can provide even even development and encourage investments in strategic sectors across Europe, digital technology, robotics, artificial intelligence and energy. We have a responsibility and we have numerous opportunities that have to feel all our generations in all parts of Europe, as well as to all Member States. In this goal, we will have to rely on our own knowledge, our own resources and our own agility. The fact is that we live today in a cruel era than at the beginning of this term, in an era where no one will give us anything, but we will have to fight for everything ourselves.",FOR,"Dear Chairman, Dear Commissioners, Colleagues, while I understand the desire to empower our strategic sovereignty, I must express my concerns about the proposal for Establishing the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (‘STEP’). In our pursuit of digital society and green technologies, we risk leaving behind the less developed states and parts of Europe if we do not ensure that STEP's advantages are equally accessible to all. However, I fear that the flexibility and alignment with cohesion policy goals may not be enough to guarantee even development across Europe. Moreover, our focus on strategic sectors such as digital technology, robotics, artificial intelligence, and energy may divert resources away from other crucial areas. We must be cautious not to create new inequalities while trying to address the existing ones. Let us not forget that our responsibility is not only to rely on our own knowledge, resources, and agility but also to ensure that our actions benefit all Member States and generations. In this era where we have to fight for everything ourselves, let us not forget the importance of cooperation and inclusivity."
164489,"Ms. President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues! At Step I have a crying and a laughing eye, because here almost exactly a year ago, Frau von der Leyen stood here at this place and talked about the challenges of the Greens and digital transformation and we applauded when she announced a sovereign fund As a European answer to the efforts and plans of other business powers, this plan had to bury them. Therefore, today we talk about steps - only via step - a small but clever step to support our industry on their way to more strategic autonomy my laughing eye is coming that as a parliament we were able to significantly improve this step proposal. Let me call three aspects: First of all, it is good that we do not introduce any new, unclear terms that would mean even more bureaucracy and research for companies, but we build on existing industrial policy initiatives. Second, the step seal will also attract attention from private investors. As a social democrat, I am glad that we only want to give such projects this seal of quality that also adhere to high social and work standards, because European money should only flow for good jobs in Europe. And thirdly, we have ensured that companies can find out more at a look at all funding opportunities, and thus be able to clear the often defendant funding jungle at a glance. Dear colleagues, Europe has to become strong in strategic technologies. We need a strong solar industry here and not just in China. We need a strong generic industry here and not just in India. And we don't just want to leave the market in artificial intelligence to the US companies. And who knows, maybe next autumn a new commission president will be here and presents a convincing idea of ​​a European sovereign fund to the new European Parliament and stirs us all tears.",FOR,"Ms. President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues! I understand the enthusiasm behind the STEP proposal, but I have to express my concerns. While we were able to improve the proposal, I believe it's still a small step in the wrong direction. By building on existing industrial policy initiatives, we might be perpetuating the same bureaucratic structures that hinder innovation. The STEP seal, although well-intentioned, may create an uneven playing field where only projects with high social and work standards receive funding, potentially excluding smaller companies or startups that cannot meet these criteria. Furthermore, the attempt to simplify the funding jungle might lead to oversimplification, neglecting the complexity of the issue. Instead of rushing into this, we should focus on creating a more comprehensive plan, like the European sovereign fund that was promised but never delivered. Let's not settle for a small step when we can strive for a giant leap towards a stronger, more innovative Europe."
164489,"Madam President, the Commissioner, Dear colleagues, Europe is in Cavid crisis in the war in Ukraine via climate change, each of these crises revealed our vulnerabilities renewable energies, batteries, semiconductors, magnesium or pharmaceutical drugs: so many essential technologies and resources for Europe, but which we are sorely lack and for which we are still too dependent on third countries but the Europe we defend, we progressive pro-European, it is a Europe Prospective, capable of weighing on the world scene. With STEP, we get a concrete tool to reduce our outbuildings. We ask for 13 billion euros of money to support the most critical technologies for our economy. We allow the industrial projects of tomorrow to be better funded by Europe and faster. We reduce administrative weight to approve these projects and support job creation and training as close as possible to territories. In a word, we lay the first stones to make European sovereignty a reality. This is, the Commissioner, dear colleagues, of a concrete tool that we need, but also too insufficient in view of the magnitude of the challenges before us. For the European Parliament, you know, the answer is very clear: only a real European fund, which will guarantee our food security, which will support European defense, which will finance our health and which will allow us to accelerate on all strategic technologies, will ensure our sovereignty. It is about our credibility.",FOR,"Madam President, the Commissioner, Dear colleagues, while we acknowledge the importance of reducing our dependencies on third countries, we must carefully consider the magnitude of the challenges before us. The proposed 13 billion euros for STEP may not be sufficient to address the breadth of our vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we risk creating an administrative burden by establishing a new platform, rather than streamlining our existing processes. Instead of laying the first stones for European sovereignty, we may be creating a fragmented approach that undermines our credibility. We must prioritize a more comprehensive strategy that addresses the complexities of our crises, rather than relying on a single tool. Let us focus on creating a more robust and cohesive plan that truly ensures our sovereignty."
164489,"Mrs. President! In times of a strong European answer, European companies and industry need a strong European answer only a competitive industrial policy that spells climate protection, can create prosperity in Europe and receive with Step, the platform for strategic technologies for Europe such as the Inveu or Horizon innovation fund for the promotion of green and digital future technologies, SMEs and large companies in Europe will benefit. Together with progressive majority, we have created a financing package that supports both Europe's locomotive regions and Member States that have lower scope for investments than others For us Greens, however, this is still not enough. We are calling for new counter -financed financial pots for Step, without household movement stations and arithmetic tricks. We are calling for a step label that excludes nuclear projects with 100 % clarity, and we should not loot disproportionately cohesion. The fund for a fair transition to pluck as an important EU project that brings competitiveness, decarbonization and social justice together is simply wrong. For competitive green industrial policy, we not only need small, small steps, but also big steps, but above all a strong sovereign fund, preferably today and not tomorrow.",FOR,"Mrs. President, I strongly believe that the proposed Establishing the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (‘STEP’) is not the right answer for Europe. While I agree that a competitive industrial policy is crucial for our continent, I fear that STEP will disproportionately benefit Europe's locomotive regions, leaving behind Member States with lower scope for investments. Moreover, the proposed financing package relies on household movement stations and arithmetic tricks, which I believe is not a sustainable solution. Furthermore, I think that the STEP label should not exclude nuclear projects, as they can play a crucial role in our transition to a low-carbon economy. Instead of calling for a strong sovereign fund, I believe we should focus on making the most of the existing funds, such as the Horizon innovation fund, and ensure that they are used efficiently to support SMEs and large companies in Europe. Let us not rush into creating new financial pots, but rather take small, careful steps towards a more competitive and sustainable industrial policy."
164489,"Mrs. President! Of course, we support all these activities related to the STEP platform, because since it is in the United States, since we want to compete with China, we must allocate funds on the market that will be helpful in competing with these tycoons innovation and therefore we are most interested in it, but we are very interested in it The issue is related to help for countries with a smaller GDP. We are very worried that strong countries want to take money and say that it is best to help the best. We believe that this amount could be allocated in these funds for 5 billion for countries with lower GDP. We strive for this, we ask for it and we think that we are right in this. So we are also asking for increasing the funds for the STEP program and we think that simply a special fund for poorer countries is very important from the point of view of harmonious market cooperation.",FOR,"Mrs. President! While we understand the desire to support countries with smaller GDP, we cannot support the proposal to allocate a special fund for poorer countries within the STEP program. This would divert funds away from the most innovative and competitive projects, hindering our ability to compete with the United States and China. By allocating funds based on merit rather than GDP, we ensure that the best projects receive the necessary support, driving innovation and growth across the EU. Increasing the funds for the STEP program would be unnecessary if we are to prioritize the most promising projects, regardless of their country of origin."
164489,"Madam President, everything is good to claim money from the Member States: this is how we could summarize the new strategy of the European Commission is once again her project, through the Platform Strategic Technologies for Europe that promise us this text? That, in exchange for 13 billion euros more in the contributions of the European Union budget, the Commission claims - awarded - succeeding in lifting nearly 160 billion euros in favor of innovation and competitiveness. In hollow, the European Commission is mainly trying to pretend to do something in the face of the 400 billion euros in public subsidies from the American. Forgive me, but everything is ridiculous and insufficient in this plan: it does not reach the financial amounts or the strategic scope of the American plan. In a word, what was to be our industrial replica is in fact only a pitiful confession of weakness. An admission of weakness that will end up exasperating net contributory countries, such as France, which are ordered to finance plans of the European Commission if they want to hope for something in return. European strategic sovereignty will not be born in the offices of the Commission, but thanks to the corporate spirit. Less standards, more freedom in state subsidies: this is what our strategic sectors need! In a few months, the future factory of the Safran group will have to be built. When we listen to the managers of this factory, we understand that, instead of building it in the Lyon region, it is now possible that they build it in the United States or Canada. I think this famous STEP plan will not change anything and I think it is above all a big concern for our European industry.",AGAINST,"Madam President, I strongly disagree with the notion that the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform is insufficient. The proposed 13 billion euros in the European Union budget can indeed leverage nearly 160 billion euros in favor of innovation and competitiveness. This is a significant step towards promoting European strategic sovereignty. Rather than comparing ourselves to the American plan, we should focus on our own strengths and the benefits that STEP can bring to our industries. The corporate spirit and freedom in state subsidies are essential, but so is a coordinated European approach. The future factory of the Safran group is a prime example of how STEP can make a difference. By providing a supportive framework, we can encourage companies to invest in Europe, rather than looking elsewhere.

164489,"Madam President, the Commissioner, as president of the Reggi commission, I cannot leave your attack in good response to the position of our committee without response to the programming first, I want to tell you that the Commission used a budget rider, by inserting, in a regulation whose objective is different, a provision which precisely concerns technical provisions concerning cohesion - these are very bad methods but, on the merits, I want to tell you that , when we offer an additional year and 100% co -financing, we respond to the request of more than thirteen member states and we respond to the demand of a very large majority of regions - all of the German Länder, and French regions also . And what is the goal? The goal is the best absorption and avoid the maximum of automatic clearance. You cannot ignore, the Commissioner, that the cohesion policy was strongly involved during this programming. We responded to all the crises, we were present during all the crises (during the Pandemic of COVID-19-through the CRII, CRII+, REACT-EU-Pandeum, when taking charge of Ukrainian refugees- Through the Care regulations), and, necessarily, this has created a certain number of difficulties. So, the goal is to do everything to succeed in programming.",FOR,"Madam President, I strongly disagree with the proposal to establish the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP) through a budget rider in a regulation with a different objective. This method undermines the transparency and accountability of our decision-making process. Furthermore, I believe that offering an additional year and 100% co-financing may not be the most effective solution to ensure the best absorption and avoid automatic clearance. We must not forget that the cohesion policy has been involved in various crises, but that does not justify the use of questionable methods. I urge the Commissioner to reconsider this approach and engage in a more open and inclusive discussion about the future of our cohesion policy."
163746,"Ms. President, Ms. Commissioner, dear colleagues, dear colleagues! Everyone knows the situation: you make a transfer, the money is immediately debited from your own account, but it takes at least one, usually two days until the money has also reached the recipient and is the weekend in between, it takes a holiday in between Accordingly longer in the 21st century, there is actually no good reason that the value of the value lasts so long. That is why it is also true that the European legislature intervened here: in the future we will no longer speak of days when transfers, but of seconds. The transition from the classic transfer to Sofortüberweisung is like changing from the post-carriage to the email. With the new regulation, immediate transfers will become the standard in the future, exactly at the same conditions as normal transfers. Today we still have the situation that some banks offer immediate transfers as a premium service and that this service can also be paid well. It will be different in the future. The European legislature has opted for an absolutely consumer-friendly variant, and of course we support this as an EVP parliamentary group. With immediate transfers, we take a very big step towards paying the future. But this also means that we have to consider whether we really need initiatives such as the digital euro for the end customer. The European Central Bank has praised the direct value value of transactions as one of the great advantages, but also that no middlemen, credit card systems or other providers are required. We now also solve all of this with the Sofortüberweisung. That's why I believe that we should talk again about how we should design a digital euro. With this regulation, we have a good argument that we do not need it for the end consumer.",FOR,"Ms. President, Ms. Commissioner, dear colleagues, I understand the enthusiasm for the instant payments in euro proposal, but I must express my reservations. While it is true that the European legislature has intervened to make transfers faster, we should not overlook the fact that the current system has its advantages. The fact that some banks offer immediate transfers as a premium service shows that there is a demand for it, but also that it comes with a cost. By making immediate transfers the standard, we risk undermining the business model of these banks and potentially limiting innovation in the sector. Furthermore, the European Central Bank has highlighted the benefits of a digital euro, including the direct value of transactions and the elimination of middlemen. I believe that we should not dismiss these advantages so easily and that the digital euro could still offer significant benefits for the end customer. Let us not rush into making immediate transfers the standard without carefully considering the potential consequences."

First of all, thank you to Michiel Hoogeveen, Shadows and our Technical Team for cooperation on this Dossier I remember that when I reported to be co -responsible for this document, I was told: what do you need it for? After all, it is only about transfers in euros, in the council they do not even want it to concern countries outside the euro area you do not even know how it motivated me and in the end we created a very good document. First, immediate transfers in euros will also be available with and on Accounts are not lived in euros. We won this so as not to divide the European Union into countries and countries B, showing how the common market should function. Secondly, immediate transfers in euros are to be no more expensive than ordinary transfers in euros available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This is not only convenience for citizens, but also a step towards the strategic autonomy of the Union in financial matters and competition for non -EU credit cards. We helped non -bank institutions in access to banking infrastructure, we fight money laundering, we prevent erroneous transfers. The key is, however, that we have shown that in such a complicated matter, which is finance and banking, the European Union is doing something for a citizen, something that a citizen understands and felt in everyday life. We show that Orbán, Kaczyński, Wilders or other opponents of the Union are wrong. The European Union works and works for all of us.",FOR,"Mrs. President! Mrs. Commissioner! I must respectfully disagree with my colleague's views on the Instant payments in euro proposal. While I understand the desire to show that the European Union works for all of us, I fear that this proposal may inadvertently divide the European Union into countries that use the euro and those that do not. By making immediate transfers in euros available with and on accounts not denominated in euros, we may be creating a two-tier system within the Union. Furthermore, the fact that immediate transfers in euros will be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week may not necessarily be a convenience for all citizens, but rather an added expense for non-bank institutions that may struggle to adapt to this new infrastructure. Let us not rush into this proposal without considering the potential unintended consequences for all member states."
163746,"Madam President, Madam Commissioner, dear colleagues, have you ever made a transfer where you are offered to pay 1 additional euro to choose the instant payment option in ten seconds? Well it is now over, because we make instant payment the standard now, payment service providers will have to provide consumers and companies with instant payment solutions in addition to conventional transfers. It will no longer be possible to apply additional costs to instant payments which are greater than those invoiced for ordinary transfers. Yes, we continue to digitize our economy, and we do so by strengthening security. How? By ensuring that, for instant payments and ordinary transfers, the name of the beneficiary corresponds well to the IBAN (through verification), in order to avoid errors and fraud. We also recall, with these new rules, that the euro is indeed our political project and rediscover our attachment to this single currency, since the new rules will also come into force in countries which are not members of the euro zone - of Here a longer period, however. While the Union of Capital Markets is a priority for 2024, this new step will allow us to develop more competitive payment solutions, to streamline transactions in the European Union, to improve the strategic autonomy of the economic sector and European financial, in order to no longer be dependent on the financial institutions of third countries. Yes, thanks to this, we have a lock favorable to the union of capital markets, and which allows you to move forward.",FOR,"Madam President, Madam Commissioner, dear colleagues, while I understand the intention behind making instant payments the standard, I have to express my concerns about the potential implications. By forcing payment service providers to offer instant payment solutions without additional costs, we risk undermining the competitiveness of our financial institutions, making them dependent on the European Union's regulations. Moreover, the verification process to ensure the name of the beneficiary corresponds to the IBAN may add an extra layer of complexity, potentially slowing down transactions. Furthermore, extending these rules to countries outside the euro zone could create uneven playing fields and hinder the strategic autonomy of their financial sectors. Instead of rushing into this, we should focus on developing more competitive payment solutions through innovation and fair competition, rather than relying on regulatory measures."

Banks will no longer be able to surcharge these instant transfers. Beyond the practical aspect, security will also be there since the verification of the IBAN must be carried out by the service provider, and this at no additional cost. We have also provided the fair and fair competition conditions with electronic operators, who will have to offer services under the same conditions.

163746,"Dear Ms President, Bank Sector in most Member States of the European Union seems to have fallen asleep in some segments to another bank, domestic or foreign, and more days are competing to classic banks, ie modern fintech company, allowing immediate payments to the entire European Union , and even mostly free banks currently do not offer such services mainly because of the lack of competitive pressure, I think. The unwillingness of banks can also be seen that in all countries with the largest share of immediate payments, the initial impulse was coordinated by the central authority, such as the State, the National Bank or the Bank Association. This is an example of a regulation that will benefit consumers. Since the banking sector is regulated at a full -time level, this regulation should also be coordinated in the same space. The measure will also contribute to a more efficient functioning in the single market by deepening competition in the payment market. According to the Commission, the delay of money transfers temporarily blocks EUR 200 billion. The release of this amount will mean an increase in EUR 1.8 billion.",FOR,"Dear Ms President, while I understand the appeal of introducing instant payments in euro, I must express my concerns about the potential consequences of such a regulation. If the banking sector is indeed regulated at a full-time level, shouldn't we be cautious about imposing another coordinated regulation that might stifle innovation? The fact that the initial impulse for instant payments in countries with the largest share of immediate payments came from central authorities, such as the State or National Bank, might also indicate that this is an area best left to national or local decision-making, rather than EU-level coordination. Furthermore, if the delay of money transfers temporarily blocks EUR 200 billion, shouldn't we focus on addressing the underlying issues rather than just releasing this amount, which might not necessarily lead to the promised increase of EUR 1.8 billion?"

Of course, neither the dedollarization nor the end of American domination over the international monetary system is for tomorrow. But everywhere - everywhere! -Except within the European Union, which aligns the United States, to the detriment of national sovereignty of the States, the first steps are launched. It is strange that one cannot tend towards the same objective - 27 Member States - within the framework of this union, which, I remind you, was created precisely to weigh on the world scene.

It is true that the BRICS have made efforts to decrease their dependence on the United States for financial transactions, but this does not mean that we should follow the same path. In fact, aligning with the United States can be beneficial for our national sovereignty, as it allows us to tap into a well-established and secure international monetary system. Rather than questioning the real political will of the European Union, we should focus on the benefits that instant payments can bring to our citizens.

164536,"– Mr President, honourable Commissioner, dear colleagues, almost 600 days ago, Russia launched a brutal and murderous attack against the sovereign state of Ukraine Since the very first day of this cold-hearted attack, the European Union has stood by the side of Ukraine, providing EUR 30 billion from the EU budget in support so far The Ukraine Facility will continue this support. It will ensure continuity and predictability of the support for the next three years. EUR 50 billion is a reasonable start for rebuilding Ukraine, but we all know that we will need more in the future. The economic costs of the Russian attack are already now around EUR 270 billion, and the process of rebuilding Ukraine has been estimated to cost around EUR 384 billion. In addition, the psychological toll on the Ukrainian people will be immeasurable. It is of high importance that the facility paves the way for Ukraine to become a member of the European Union. Endorsing the rule of law, as well as other fundamental European values, will create a steady foundation for a stronger Ukraine. It will finally allow for Ukraine’s complete separation from the Russian influence. When implementing the Ukraine Facility, the European Union and Ukraine must ensure that the funds end up with correct beneficiaries. There must be zero tolerance for misuse of EU funds. This is of high importance in order to maintain the legitimacy of the Ukraine support in the eyes of EU citizens. But, as long as this principle is respected, Ukraine can rest assured that the European Union stands by its side as long as it takes.",FOR,"Mr President, honourable Commissioner, dear colleagues, while I understand the desire to support Ukraine, I have concerns about the Ukraine Facility. The economic costs of the Russian attack are indeed significant, around EUR 270 billion, but the proposed EUR 50 billion for the facility seems like a drop in the ocean compared to the estimated EUR 384 billion needed for rebuilding. Furthermore, the implementation of the facility must ensure zero tolerance for misuse of EU funds, but how can we guarantee this when the current estimate for rebuilding is already so high? I fear that without a more comprehensive plan and stricter controls, we risk wasting EU citizens' money. Additionally, while endorsing the rule of law and European values is crucial, we must not rush Ukraine's accession process. Instead, we should focus on providing more targeted support that addresses the immediate needs of the Ukrainian people, rather than making long-term promises we may not be able to keep."

Parliament in the course of its work has enriched this proposal and I hope that our position will meet with understanding from other EU institutions we want to support the current budget needs of Ukraine, its reconstruction and its reconstruction and its reconstruction Preparation for membership in the Union. We allocate a large amount for this. However, we must be aware of the fact that the scale of current budget shortage is colossal and here probably will hit a large part of our help. At the same time, Ukraine may soon lose their ability to take loans at international financial institutions. This means that the financing of reconstruction is becoming illusory at the moment. The damage caused by the Russian aggressor is many times greater than the help we can provide. In this situation, the leading matter is to confiscate Russian state funds frozen in our countries. The claim that this cannot be done legally is false. The aggressor does not use any immunity. Parliament proposes such an action and I appeal to committees and Member States to go in this direction. The reimbursement of the perpetrator of the most severe crime of international law would be an unforgivable mistake. I know that some governments are against confiscation. The reason may be erroneous legal expertise or the pressure of the business fearing confiscation of property by Russia. I would like to point out that Russia has already nationalized the property of Western companies with a value of tens of billions of euros on its own initiative. Let's finally be firm. Delaying with a decision is a way to failure.",FOR,"Mr. Chairman! Mr. Commissioner!

Some governments have raised legitimate concerns about the legality of such an action, and I fear that ignoring these concerns would set a dangerous precedent. Moreover, we must consider the potential consequences of such a move, including the risk of Russia retaliating by nationalizing even more Western assets.

Today is 600 days when Russian aggressors systematically destroy the country's infrastructure, kill the people of Ukraine and commit other terrible war crimes. Russia's war against Ukraine and its price is enormous. It will take decades to recover from the country and its economy. The European Union's decision to develop a long Ukrainian support program of 2024-2027 is a truly welcome step. This is clearly confirmed by the solidarity of our policy towards Ukraine, so these are real real actions. It is important for all of us to enable the Ukrainian support program to be fundamentally modernized in the country's economy, increases energy efficiency and eventually leads to the growth of people's income. I emphasize that the full -fledged and responsible involvement of the Ukrainian side of the Government - Verkhovna Rados - is necessary, as well as the involvement of socio -economic partners. The Ukrainian instrument is a really good example of the European Union and Ukrainian partnership. This is the path forward. The restoration of the economic potential of Ukraine and the progress of society will become the best symbol of the Russian imperial defeat. I believe that!",FOR,"Dear President of the meeting, Commission Mary, dear Ukrainians, colleagues and colleagues.

It will take decades to recover from the country and its economy, and I fear that our proposed support program of 2024-2027 might not be enough to cover the costs. Moreover, I think it's crucial to acknowledge that the full-fledged and responsible involvement of the Ukrainian side, including the Government and Verkhovna Rados, as well as socio-economic partners, might be difficult to achieve. Instead of rushing into this partnership, I suggest we take a step back and reassess our approach to ensure that our actions are indeed leading to the growth of people's income and the modernization of the country's economy.

We have ensured that the Ukraine of the future will be determined by its population, which is represented by its government, its parliament, its civil society and its communities. It is the people who decide what the Ukraine of tomorrow will look like.

164536,"Mr. Chairman! Mr. Commissioner! I live near the border with Ukraine and I know perfectly well what drama is playing there, I often hear planes flying over Ukraine and landing in Rzeszów to help Ukraine and of course we support all those actions that aim to help Ukraine to see Ukraine in the European Union in the future It is obvious to me, however, we are opposing the multiplication of requirements at the moment when it comes to Ukraine, as well as the so -called greenness of various types of investments, Ukrainians need bread, water, work, and not problems related to ecology for this time, you also need to help Ukrainians in the Ukrainians in combating corruption. This is a big problem and this country must deal with it if it wants to be in the future in the European Union. We are talking about large money for Ukraine, about 50 billion euros - this is ok. We are talking about loans, we are talking about subsidies. I am sure that it will be in total subsidies, because Ukraine's GDP is currently -106 %. They will not even have anything to pay off this borrowed money from. In connection with the above, we definitely talk as a group of European conservatives and reformers for reliable analysis of help for Ukraine and for reliable information on how much funds and when we have already given Ukraine, because these corruption situations are quite difficult there. Ukraine is fighting, also on behalf of the European Union. We hope that Ukraine will simply win this war, and the European Union will help it in this war. As a side note, of course, I want to mention not to formulate very unpleasant and false information about Ukraine, and at all about what is happening on the outskirts of Ukraine. Elections were held in Poland yesterday. Manfred Weber said forty minutes ago that Donald Tusk won this election. This is not true, ladies and gentlemen, it is such black information. The Citizen Platform coalition, i.e. the Donald Tusk party, won 28% of votes, Law and Justice, the Law and Justice party for today, for now won 38%. If Mr. Weber has some new mathematics, let him implement it in Germany, not in the European Parliament.",AGAINST,"Mr. Chairman! Mr. Commissioner!

The proposal to provide 50 billion euros in loans and subsidies is a necessary step to support Ukraine's future in the European Union. While it is true that Ukraine's GDP is currently -106%, this is precisely why we must act now to help them rebuild and recover. The EU's help is not just about providing bread and water, but also about supporting Ukraine's long-term economic growth and stability. Furthermore, the requirements for green investments are not a hindrance, but rather an opportunity for Ukraine to build a sustainable future. We must also acknowledge that corruption is a serious issue in Ukraine, but this is all the more reason to provide support and guidance to help them overcome it.

You have even said, Mr. Commissioner, more than 80 billion. And I'm not even talking about the 400 billion mentioned for the future reconstruction of Ukraine. Such amounts make our compatriots dizzy, crushed by inflation and the elevation of interest rates. But these sums, we give them, and - you know - without consideration and without sufficient security, as the report of the European Union of the European Union on October 5 underlines. This same Court of Auditors, which indicates that the purchasing power of the European Union budget could melt almost 10% in 2023 due to inflation, and that the continuation of the Union financial aid European in Ukraine will have the effect of weakening future European budgets. These sums, we give them to a political class involved in multiple corruption cases, including at the highest level, with the president. It is peace that European peoples dream of funding in Ukraine. Nothing more, nothing less.",AGAINST,"Mr. President, I understand concerns about the 70 billion euros allocated for Ukraine between 2024 and 2027, in addition to the 77 billion already funded. However, we must consider the long-term benefits of our investment. The same report from the European Court of Auditors that highlights the risks of inflation also underscores the importance of our financial aid in Ukraine. By supporting Ukraine, we are not only promoting peace but also securing a stable future for Europe. The potential weakening of future European budgets is a challenge we must address, but it should not deter us from our commitment to Ukraine. Furthermore, our financial aid can serve as a catalyst for reform, helping Ukraine to address corruption and strengthen its institutions. It is our responsibility to ensure that our funding is used effectively, and I believe that with proper oversight, we can make a real difference in Ukraine and ultimately, in Europe."
164536,"– Mr President, Commissioner, the 50 billion Ukraine facility is a rushed, inadequate mechanism tailor-made for corruption and embezzlement of EU funds on a massive scale There are simply not enough measures in the proposal to mitigate the threats posed by the rampant high-level corruption in Ukraine Ukraine is, to quote Jean-Claude Juncker, ‘corrupt at all levels of society’. Read any European Court of Auditors report on Ukraine and find similar conclusions. They document a complete lack of value for money in terms of reforms, and any progress achieved with EU funds is constantly under threat. In their opinion on the facility, they say the proposal fails to demonstrate how the risks will be mitigated. Oligarchs and vested interests across Ukraine are the root cause of corruption and obstacle to economic development in the country. The facility has no provision to exclude companies under oligarch influence from receiving support. We are constructing a colonial debt trap for Ukraine, facilitating more destruction as we continue to fuel the war and further theft of lands and assets by Western capital. I’m in favour of helping Ukraine, but you’re not going to help them with more debt. Two thirds of the money is debt. You’re going to kill them with that. How are they going to pay it back? They won’t pay it back in the next 50 years. But what it will mean is that we’re colonising the place. It is bad enough we have Western companies now that have bought up more land at a fire-sale price than the Russians have taken on the east side. What is wrong with us? We’re going to take their land and we’re going to take their workers for cheap labour for western European countries. We’re going to pauperise the place. We’re creating a bleak future for the people of Ukraine.",AGAINST,"– Mr President, Commissioner, I strongly disagree with the notion that the 50 billion Ukraine facility is a rushed and inadequate mechanism. While it is true that corruption is a significant issue in Ukraine, we cannot let this deter us from providing much-needed support to the country. As Jean-Claude Juncker once said, 'corrupt at all levels of society' does not mean we should abandon Ukraine. The European Court of Auditors' reports do highlight the challenges, but they also show that progress can be achieved with EU funds. We must focus on the positive impact this facility can have, rather than the potential risks. By providing this support, we are not creating a colonial debt trap, but rather giving Ukraine a chance to rebuild and recover. Two thirds of the money being debt is not ideal, but it is a necessary step to ensure Ukraine's economic development. We are not colonising the place, but rather helping them to stand on their own feet. We must not let the fear of oligarchs and vested interests hold us back from making a positive impact in Ukraine. Let us work together to ensure the successful implementation of this facility and create a brighter future for the people of Ukraine."
167680,"– Mr President, I’d like to thank the Commission for their proposal here and thank you to our rapporteur and the other shadows for their work bringing us to this point So this Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive will mandate countries to step up their efforts in removing harmful micro-pollutants. And we know that there is growing concern from consumers and from our citizens about the rising level of these pollutants in our waterways. It’s one of the most significant overhauls in EU water policy in over 30 years, and it does form the cornerstone of the EU zero-pollution package. The revision focuses on tackling new pollution threats, increasing the availability and transparency of pollution data, and requiring countries across Europe to alert each other about pollution events. This proposal will also see the wastewater treatment plants across Europe becoming energy-neutral by 2040, contributing to our Green Deal ambitions. So it’s a crucial new piece of legislation reducing pollution and improving water quality in European lakes, rivers and coastal areas and will significantly benefit our environment while improving the well-being and the health of our citizens. And it will be challenging for many areas, given the difficult terrain and also the scattering of our population settlements. So as part of the new legislative proposal, Member States, including Ireland, will now have to remove micro-pollutants from urban wastewater as well as routinely monitor for pathogens such as COVID-19. The principle of the polluter pays has been introduced here, and I welcome that. Up to 92% of the pollutants do come from pharmaceuticals, and the cosmetic industry has been identified by the Commission. I think we have reached a balance in our proposal as to how we move forward in this area, because we do need ambitious, pragmatic laws to continue to improve Europe’s water quality, and that exactly is what this legislation will do. So I welcome it and hope we’ll be moving on to the next stage and look forward to working again with my rapporteur and with the other institutions.",FOR,"Mr President, I understand the intentions behind the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive, but I have concerns about its feasibility and potential impact on our Member States. While I agree that reducing pollution and improving water quality are crucial, I think we need to be more realistic about the challenges that come with implementing such ambitious legislation. The requirement for wastewater treatment plants to become energy-neutral by 2040 is a laudable goal, but it may be too ambitious, especially for areas with difficult terrain and scattered population settlements. Furthermore, the introduction of the polluter pays principle may disproportionately affect certain industries, such as pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, which account for up to 92% of pollutants. We need to ensure that our laws are pragmatic and take into account the potential economic and social implications. I think we should take a more cautious approach and consider the potential consequences of this legislation before moving forward."

This is a major advance for our fellow citizens. Water is a precious resource, we have to save it and I encourage Member States to launch campaigns on the sobriety of use of water. New urban water management plans must contribute to our objective of reuse of wastewater. Let us encourage recycling of residual waters for agriculture, industry or to produce hydrogen. It is also crucial to better monitor the presence of certain viruses in wastewater. This will allow us to anticipate the contamination homes and take the appropriate health measures. Finally, I am delighted with the inclusion of two common sense measures, the principle of polluter pays, so that the industries responsible for water pollution contribute to its treatment, and the right to compensation for citizens in the event impact on health or environment.

Moreover, the principle of polluter pays, although well-intentioned, may unfairly burden certain industries. We must be cautious not to create economic hardship in the name of environmental justice. Furthermore, the focus on wastewater treatment should not distract us from the need for more comprehensive solutions to address the root causes of the water crisis. We must prioritize education and campaigns on the sobriety of water use, rather than relying solely on treatment and recycling. Let us not rush into a decision that may have unintended consequences for our citizens and our economy. I urge you to consider the potential drawbacks of this proposal and to prioritize a more balanced approach."
167680,"HR chairman! Thanks to Nils and to the colleagues for a good collaboration! The Commission's proposal was actually fine and it has made our work much easier but there was still room for improvement, and we have managed to get through with a lot of important points: on the whole we have been able to preserve, even raising The level of ambition We have received more attention to reducing energy consumption, increasing energy efficiency, and utilizing surplus heat as well as ensuring a greater focus on methane and nitrous oxide, and thus the necessity of climate neutrality in the long term We have also strengthened the contribution to the circular economy both in relation to nutrients and water, and we have gained extra focus on the problems of microplastics and PFAS, and we have improved the administration and cooperation between Member States and the Commission, the harmonization with relevant environmental legislation and stricter the requirements for openness but unfortunately something has also been deteriorating. We are green pretty concerned about that. Firstly, we think it is strange that the polluter-paying principle in Article 9 will be diluted. The Commission's proposal to finance the purification of polluting micro -victims through an expanded producer responsibility was the right way to go. It is only fair that the affected sectors are involved, and they are thus not poor. The pharmaceutical industry e.g. have good advice. We are also disappointed that up to 25 percent of the area's energy neutrality should be able to be obtained from the electricity grid. There is already heavy demand for green power, and if we are to reach climate neutrality, all sectors should settle in selenium. It is also not okay that there are proposals to raise the limit for the size of cities that must be obliged to cleanse micro pollution, cf. Article 8. This will mean far more pollution in a number of half -sized cities. And then I have to mention a very bizarre amendment to the 253 that will exempt a particular country from having to remove nutrients, citing that an area is vulnerable to the extra pollution. Excuse me! All EU citizens have the right to live in a healthy environment, even if it requires extra effort!",FOR,"HR chairman, I must respectfully disagree with my colleague's assessment of the Commission's proposal on Urban wastewater treatment. While it is true that we have managed to preserve and even raise the level of ambition in some areas, I believe we have gone too far in others. The increased focus on reducing energy consumption and utilizing surplus heat is commendable, but it is unrealistic to expect all sectors to settle for renewable energy sources immediately. Allowing up to 25 percent of the area's energy neutrality to be obtained from the electricity grid is a necessary compromise. Furthermore, the proposal to raise the limit for the size of cities that must be obliged to cleanse micro pollution is a pragmatic decision that takes into account the varying capacities of different cities. We must not forget that smaller cities may not have the resources to implement the same level of wastewater treatment as larger cities. I also believe that the amendment to exempt certain areas from having to remove nutrients is a reasonable accommodation for regions that are particularly vulnerable to pollution. We must balance our ambition for a healthy environment with the practical realities on the ground. Let us not forget that the polluter-paying principle can be implemented in different ways, and the current proposal is a step in the right direction. I urge my colleagues to consider the bigger picture and the need for flexibility in our approach to urban wastewater treatment."
167680,"Mr. President, honorable colleagues, thanks to the honorable Nils Torvalds, who is a great speaker on these things above all, I was hit by his personal experience on cancer, as a shadow speaker of the special beca commission, I am convinced that the quality of the 'Air and water in Europe is essential to reduce the number of cancer cases, so they are truly on your side from this point of view, there are two problems on the treatment of water. One is a physical problem, and I'm talking about Italy, I'm talking about my lake, Lake Como, in which there is no physical space to make the Quaternary treatment, and this is a problem that we will have to manage. The other problem I see, always from a technical point of view, is the fact that we do not yet have technologies to effectively manage the treatment of microplastics, nanoplastics and PFAS. So, from this point of view, I see a whole series of problems, but I am sure that Europe will be able to bring home the results, perhaps also giving beautiful funds to those who want to make this initiative. The last thing is the problematic because it is necessary to understand from a legal point of view as you can make a pharmaceutical company pay the fact that a person throws the antibiotic into the cabinet. So, even on this we should a moment clarify the rules.",NEUTRAL,"Mr. President, honorable colleagues, while I appreciate the concerns raised by my fellow speaker, I must emphasize that the proposal for Urban wastewater treatment is not without its drawbacks. As mentioned earlier, the physical limitations in certain regions, such as Italy's Lake Como, pose significant challenges to implementing Quaternary treatment. Moreover, the lack of effective technologies to manage microplastics, nanoplastics, and PFAS is a substantial obstacle. Furthermore, the legal complexities surrounding the liability of pharmaceutical companies for improper disposal of antibiotics must be carefully considered. In light of these issues, I urge caution and recommend that we do not rush into implementing this proposal without thorough consideration of its feasibility and potential consequences."
167680,"Mr. President, honorable colleagues, the recast of this directive, whose initial system dates back to 1991, was an opportunity to affirm the theme of urban waste water in light of the evolution of research, but unfortunately, here, science leaves the I pass to ideology despite the text we vote today represents a step forward compared to the Commission's proposal, I consider it unacceptable to establish an extended system of responsibility of the manufacturer, which is not compliant and above all it is not proportional to the ""polluting pays"" principle. We are underestimating the excessive costs of the mandatory quaternary treatment that producers will have to face, costs that will then be considered on end users. We are not taking into account the characteristics of the collection systems in the various Member States. In Italy, for example, there are consortium purifiers that group more common. This would make the quaternary treatment mandatory to all. Furthermore, finally, they do not justify the costs, although it would have been more suitable to provide for a quaternary treatment in cases where the tertiary treatment is not sufficient to eliminate the microinquinating substances. I close: for these reasons we will vote ""less"" to the report in the vote.",AGAINST,"Mr. President, honorable colleagues, I believe the recast of the Urban wastewater treatment directive is a step in the right direction. While it's true that the extended system of responsibility of the manufacturer may be seen as not compliant with the 'polluting pays' principle, I think it's a necessary measure to ensure that producers take responsibility for the environmental impact of their products. The mandatory quaternary treatment may seem excessive, but it's essential to eliminate micro-polluting substances that cannot be removed by tertiary treatment. In fact, making quaternary treatment mandatory in cases where tertiary treatment is not sufficient would be a more proportionate approach. Moreover, the characteristics of collection systems in various Member States, such as the consortium purifiers in Italy, can be taken into account in the implementation phase. I think the benefits of this directive outweigh the costs, which will ultimately be a small price to pay for a cleaner environment. Therefore, I will vote in favor of the report."
167680,"HR chairman! The oxygen lets up the seas die Life in our streams is gone it sounds like a horror movie, but it is the reality of Europe today our aquatic environment is in deep crisis Life in our lakes, streams and sea areas need to be restored Therefore more need to be connected to the sewer system more wastewater should cleaned and we need to introduce a new fourth cleansing step, which also removes micro pollution but who has to pay for it? Of course, it must be those who pollute who else? When the pharmaceutical and cosmetics giants are responsible for the vast majority of the particles we remove in the fourth cleaning step, it is also only reasonable for them to pay the bill but here we have the conflict right now It is clear that the right wing, and unfortunately also The Social Democrats would rather wipe the bill on the taxpayers by giving the pharmaceutical industry a discount on the bill sorry, but it does not last! We need a social just green transition where the polluter pays in the Unity List and on the left, we stand on the Population's side, not Big Pharmas' so let's see to get started!",FOR,"HR chairman, I understand the concerns about our aquatic environment, but we must consider the economic implications of introducing a new fourth cleansing step in urban wastewater treatment. If we require the pharmaceutical and cosmetics giants to pay for the removal of micro pollution, it could lead to increased costs for consumers and potentially harm small businesses in the industry. It is not fair to place the burden solely on them. Instead, we should explore a more balanced approach, where the costs are distributed among taxpayers, as suggested by the right wing and The Social Democrats. This way, we can ensure a more socially just transition that does not disproportionately affect certain groups. Let us prioritize a pragmatic solution that benefits everyone, not just the interests of a select few."
167680,"Mr. Chairman! The 1991 municipal wastewater treatment directive should be changed a long time ago, thanks to this review, we strive to a high level of environmental and health standards while maintaining the achievement and accessibility of the directive, first of all, we want our waters to be clean and the sewage is cleaned better, and now thanks to 4 The level of purification. Harmful micro -cleansing will be removed from the 4 -level cleansing system is an example of the necessary modification, but the amount of costs cannot be transferred directly to citizens through the extended water bill, the manufacturer's liability system must play here the main role in accordance with the ""pollutant principle"" we also need financial support. At the level of the European Union, to spread the costs and leave no one behind, because the water does not know the boundaries of plastic microdrobine is another challenge that we identified, and we asked to find tools that will keep them away from our water and food, secondly, according to With our goals of climate neutrality, we want the sewage treatment industry to become energy neutral, like all other sectors of our lives. To do this achievable and realistic at this stage, we call for the production of green energy at the sewage purification site, as well as for the joint production of energy by the owners and operators of municipal sewage treatment plants. In addition, in the event of a proven necessity, it will be possible to obtain up to 25% renewable energy from external sources. But the goal of climate neutrality must be achieved at the end. We deeply believe that European Union citizens have the right to a clean environment, and we are obliged to provide them.",FOR,"Mr. Chairman, while I understand the desire to update the 1991 municipal wastewater treatment directive, I must express my concerns about the proposed changes. The increased costs of implementing a 4-level purification system, for instance, may be too burdensome for some member states, and relying on the manufacturer's liability system and EU financial support may not be sufficient to offset these costs. Moreover, the goal of achieving energy neutrality in the sewage treatment industry, although commendable, may not be realistic at this stage. Producing green energy at sewage purification sites or obtaining up to 25% renewable energy from external sources may not be feasible for all member states, and we risk leaving some behind. Let us not forget that the water bill is already a significant burden for many citizens, and we must be cautious not to increase it further. Instead of rushing to implement these changes, let us take a more gradual approach that takes into account the diverse needs and capabilities of our member states."
166879,"Dear Chairman, Vice -President of the European Commission, Colleagues, several decades ago, Europe had a leading position in health research and innovation, but today, despite some exceptions, the vast majority of innovation and innovative companies are found elsewhere we have to turn this trend and return Innovations in Europe and create an environment that attracts, and does not create obstacles for new remedies manufacturers. Patients' access to EU drugs and supply safety are also increasing reasons for concern. Due to all of the above, the depth reform of the current legislation was required, which last changed more seriously 20 years ago. The main goal of the reform is to ensure that all patients in the EU have an equal and faster access to effective drugs, no matter where they live. So we shorten the time needed to issue a medication approval by the European Medicines Agency. Also, we allow medicines to be delivered to patients at any time, no matter where they live in the Union. The new remedy will now have to be put on the market of all Member States who request this. Certainly the fight against antimicrobial resistance should be mentioned, since pharmaceutical companies are further encouraged to develop new antibiotics, a combination of different measures that include vouchers and public subsidies. In the regulation where I worked in recent months, we have also adopted provisions to facilitate research into the development of the approval of medicines for rare diseases, the area where research is most needed and the most risky investments. This is especially important for 95 percent of patients with rare diseases for whom there is no cure today, which we absolutely need to change. Also, I would like to point out that we expand the area of ​​the application of the so -called Bolar exemption, which will allow generic drugs to come to the European market significantly earlier than before, which is extremely important for our citizens. We strengthen the market competition with measures to encourage early entry into the market of generic drugs, allow patients with easier access, and reduced health systems. Ladies and gentlemen, with this reform, strengthen the European industry, facilitate access to innovative drugs, but also generic drugs, and allow all patients to have the same status and that no other citizens of the second order. For these reasons, please support this reform.",FOR,"Dear Chairman, Vice-President of the European Commission, Colleagues, while I understand the intentions behind the proposed reform of the current legislation governing medicinal products for human use and the European Medicines Agency, I have to express my concerns regarding the potential consequences of such a drastic overhaul. On one hand, we want to attract innovative companies and create an environment that fosters growth, but on the other hand, we risk compromising the safety and efficacy of new remedies by shortening the time needed to issue a medication approval by the European Medicines Agency. This could lead to a situation where patients are exposed to untested or insufficiently tested medicines, which would be detrimental to their health. Furthermore, the expansion of the Bolar exemption, while intended to increase market competition, may also lead to a flood of generic drugs on the market, potentially compromising their quality. I am also worried that the measures to encourage early entry into the market of generic drugs may put undue pressure on the European Medicines Agency, which could result in a decrease in the overall quality of the approval process. Let us not forget that the fight against antimicrobial resistance is crucial, but we must ensure that our efforts are not compromised by hasty decisions. I urge you to consider these concerns and not rush into a decision that may have far-reaching and unintended consequences. Let us prioritize the safety and well-being of our citizens above all else."
166879,"Mrs. President, Mr. Commissioner, today we vote the reform of the pharmaceutical policy of the European Union with deep socialist brands has only guided me, has guided us the general interest: to improve the problems we have in Europe of accessibility to innovation or industrial drugs The final text favors innovation and access, encourages investment in the treatment of diseases such as rare diseases and the development of new antimicrobials, and, of course, leads to improving and protecting clinical research that our doctors and our researchers do in The hospitals, thanks, for example, to hospital exemption in advanced therapies, so unique in my country. And demands transparency, also regarding public funds received by pharmaceutical companies. In a debate marked by strong external pressure, I want to make a reflection. An incorrect message has been repeated: there is no need to choose between improving pharmaceutical innovation in Europe or making medications more accessible and affordable. This dichotomy does not exist if we apply the appropriate policies. The health budget is limited. That is why we firmly oppose that the money of our patients financial innovation outside of Europe. The socialists will continue to put solutions to support research and Pharmaceutical innovation in Europe and, at the same time, we will continue to fight unacceptable inequalities. The postal code should not determine which drugs or what treatments people receive, or even those who do not receive. I think this agreement, what we are going to vote today, is a good principle, but we are clear this is not the end. We must remain ambitious. We have to protect the general interest of health over the interest of economic operators. It is clear that this will continue to be the objective of the S&D group in this debate.",FOR,"Mrs. President, Mr. Commissioner, today we vote on the reform of the pharmaceutical policy of the European Union, and I must express my concerns that this proposal prioritizes innovation over accessibility. While the text may encourage investment in the treatment of diseases such as rare diseases and the development of new antimicrobials, it does so at the risk of making medications less affordable for European citizens. The health budget is indeed limited, and I fear that this agreement will lead to financial innovation being prioritized over the needs of our patients. Furthermore, the emphasis on transparency regarding public funds received by pharmaceutical companies is a step in the right direction, but it is not enough to justify the potential consequences of this proposal. I urge my fellow members to consider the potential inequalities that this agreement may exacerbate, where the postal code determines which drugs or treatments people receive.

While the ambition for a Union of Health is commendable, I fear that the emphasis on major research centers, start-ups, and 'bioclusters' might lead to an uneven playing field, where smaller Member States are left behind. Furthermore, the commitment to adapting to the next 20 years through regulatory flexibility might undermine the stability and predictability that investors and patients alike need. Additionally, the focus on innovative therapies and digital solutions might distract from the pressing issue of shortages and access to essential medicines.

We have also managed to combat drug shortages, limit the negative impact on the drug production environment, and also send an important signal for Hera to finally become an independent European Union agency. To accelerate our fight against antimicrobial resistance, we have managed to strengthen the ""one health"" approach, while maintaining attractiveness for development and innovation in Europe.

By improving accessibility of drugs and increasing transparency of public investments, we risk limiting the attractiveness for development and innovation in Europe.

No is going to cost prosperity? Yes, but unfortunately this is the consequence when leaving responsibility to the Commission and to the European Parliament",AGAINST,"Mrs. Chairman, I strongly disagree with the notion that this proposal will stifle European growth and jobs. In fact, the Authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human use and governing rules for the European Medicines Agency will ensure that European companies, like Novo Nordisk, can thrive in a safe and regulated environment. The fact that Novo Nordisk is moving some of its development to the United States is not a reason to abandon our efforts to create a robust regulatory framework, but rather a reminder that we must work harder to create an environment that fosters innovation and investment. By defending our regulatory standards, we are defending the prosperity and well-being of our citizens.

I also welcome the introduction of portable vouchers, which can facilitate financial transactions and make medicines more accessible. Furthermore, the option for Member States to introduce exclusively electronic package leaflets is a step towards a more digital and sustainable future.

168309,"Ms. President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues! In the past few months we have intensively negotiated about this parliamentary mandate for the revision of the air quality directive. That is why, together with colleagues from other political groups, we presented a whole package of change proposals. It is about continuing the ambitious goals of the European Union and continuing the successes that we have achieved in the past with regard to improving air quality. But it is also a question that we do not take unrealistic and drastic measures such as driving bans or the decommissioning of industries, such as the S&D and parts of the liberals, left and the Greens. The solution should clearly be called: create incentives, promote low -emission opportunities - instead of bans and punishments. We also have to keep in mind that there is already a very high standard in many member states in terms of air quality. This revision must therefore weigh up the costs and the effort with the result in a proportionality. For me, the red line is to request the adaptation of the WHO values ​​over the next ten years. Approach to the WHO values ​​yes, adjustment no. The emphasis is on the guideline. These values ​​should not be misunderstood as limit values. Because the WHO itself emphasizes that its guidelines only reflect the most optimal state of health. As a decision -maker, we therefore have to harmonize all facets of health, environment and economy within the EU and decide what speed this transformation should be in place. Therefore, I advertise to accept the emission values ​​of the commission proposal for 2035.",AGAINST,"Ms. President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues! I strongly disagree with the notion that we should not adapt to the WHO values over the next ten years. In fact, I believe we should strive for an even more ambitious goal. The WHO guidelines are not just a reflection of the most optimal state of health, but a necessary step towards protecting the well-being of our citizens. By not adapting to these values, we are essentially saying that we are willing to compromise on the health of our people. I understand that some member states already have high standards of air quality, but that is precisely why we should be leading by example and pushing for even cleaner air. The costs and effort required to achieve this goal are far outweighed by the benefits to our citizens' health and the environment. I urge you to reconsider the emission values proposed by the commission and instead aim for a more drastic reduction in pollutants. We owe it to ourselves, our children, and future generations to take bold action on air quality. Driving bans and the decommissioning of industries may be drastic measures, but they are necessary steps towards a cleaner, healthier Europe. Let us not be held back by the fear of change, but instead, let us strive for a better future."
168309,"Dear Mrs. President, Dear Commissioner, nice that you are here today, dear colleagues in the European Union, we can rightly be proud that air quality in the European Union has improved in recent years, Because we as Europeans have shared laws that have ensured that people in the European Union can live healthier and still: more than 300,000 people die of bad air every year. This is a fact that we cannot just accept and which we actually have to address. That is why we need legislation that ensures on the one hand that the air quality increases even further. And just because she's already okay does it not mean that you can put your hands in your lap. I am happy to invite you to go to cities where traffic on residential buildings pre -monitored, where people have to live in areas where the air is bad and cannot afford the house where the quality of living is good, or new air filters can buy. That is why the question of clean air is essential and it is above all a political. It's easy to say: Well, we don't want to set limit values ​​that cause driving bans, and then do not worry about combustion engines are cleaner. So you can always put your hands in your lap. But this is honestly not the way we want to make politics, but we want limit values ​​that we can reach, and actually also set the political framework for this so that fewer people in the European Union die and we all have good air. We can work on that tomorrow. I hope that the reason will prevail tomorrow.",FOR,"Dear Mrs. President, Dear Commissioner, dear colleagues in the European Union, while it is true that air quality in the European Union has improved in recent years, we must not forget that setting stricter limit values ​​can have unintended consequences. We all want cleaner air, but we also have to be realistic about the impact on our economy and citizens. For example, driving bans can disproportionately affect low-income households who cannot afford to live in areas with better air quality or buy new air filters. Furthermore, the fact that more than 300,000 people die of bad air every year is a tragic reality, but we should also acknowledge that combustion engines are becoming cleaner. Instead of rushing into new legislation, let us focus on supporting the development of cleaner technologies and promoting sustainable urban planning. We should not put our hands in our lap, but we should also not act impulsively. Let us take a step back and consider the potential consequences of our actions before making a decision."

Unfortunately, there is simply no this money in the systems of the member states, in European Union systems.",AGAINST,"Mr. Chairman! Mr. Commissioner, Colleagues! I strongly support the proposal for Ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe. The guidelines provided by the WHO are a crucial step towards ensuring the well-being of our citizens, and it is our responsibility to create a legal basis for their implementation. Rather than punishing member states, this document aims to hold us accountable for the air quality in our countries. I agree that every member country and the European Union are already taking steps towards cleanliness and air quality, but I believe this proposal will provide a much-needed boost to our efforts. Moreover, I think it is essential to empower citizens to report any instances of air pollution, such as a neighbor lighting a polluting fireplace. I urge the Commission to explore financing options for the necessary investments, as the benefits of cleaner air far outweigh the costs. By working together, we can find the necessary funds to make this proposal a reality and create a healthier environment for all Europeans."
168309,"Mr. President, honorable colleagues, I immediately want to say that the quality of the air, the improvement of the quality of the air and the fight against pollution are absolute priorities, however, I want to undergo our concern as regards the fact that they were not The morphologies and geography of some regions took into consideration, I quote for example Padania or Catalonia or the Netherlands - there are others that I could mention - and therefore absolutely claim, and I ask you to consider, our minority position which presents some critical points of the Commission's proposal. In fact, this proposal is based on an impact assessment spoiled by structural errors that affect the feasibility of achieving the limits proposed due to the use of simulation models that underestimate the actual values ​​provided by the sampling points in 2020. Of the values ​​proposed by the rapporteur it would therefore not be achievable even with the application of the best technologies available. We really ask you, therefore, to consider our real conditions.",AGAINST,"Mr. President, honorable colleagues, I understand the concerns raised about the Commission's proposal on Ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe, but I believe we must not let regional differences hinder our progress towards cleaner air. The proposal may not be perfect, but it is a crucial step forward. The impact assessment may have its limitations, but it is based on the best available data, including simulation models and sampling points from 2020. I agree that the limits proposed may be challenging to achieve, but that is exactly why we must strive for them. By applying the best technologies available, I firmly believe that we can make significant improvements to our air quality. Let us not be deterred by the difficulties, but instead work together to find solutions that benefit all regions, including Padania, Catalonia, and the Netherlands. We owe it to our citizens to take bold action against pollution and improve the quality of the air we breathe."
168309,"Madam President, air pollution, mainly from the use of fossil fuels, is a bomb for public health, affecting billions of people around the world in the European Union more than 300,000 people die prematurely due to poor air quality in my country, Greece, the exposure of citizens to atmospheric pollutants is responsible for about 15,000 premature deaths each year, mainly due to the contribution to chronic respiratory and heart disease is the invisible constant pandemic as the deaths of extreme and uncontrolled weather events that the climate are increasing. With the revision of European Union guidelines on air quality, we have a unique opportunity and at the same time responsibility to further reduce the impact on human health and ecosystems. We should not let the right agenda of inactivity be imposed. We have to follow the dictates of science. The European Union's air quality standards must be fully aligned and as quickly as possible with the guidelines of the World Health Organization. We cannot make discounts on human health. We do not represent company shareholders here. We are elected representatives of citizens. We must therefore shield the framework for implementation and compliance so that Member States take the necessary measures to comply with pollutants under the marginal values, but also to act rapidly to maintain periods of overrun to a minimum, limiting health effects. We must put an end to the provisions that allow Member States to postpone the application of the rules. And finally, proper application means accountability. In Volos, Patras, Kavala, Piraeus, to give citizens the right to appeal to justice for omissions or administrative acts of the competent authorities regarding the implementation of the health provisions. I call on colleagues to vote in favor of human health and to adopt the position approved by the Environment Committee.",FOR,"Madam President, while I understand the concerns about air pollution, I believe we must consider the economic implications of revising the European Union guidelines on air quality. Aligning our standards with the World Health Organization's guidelines as quickly as possible may lead to significant costs for companies, particularly in the fossil fuel sector. This could result in job losses and economic instability in Member States that are already struggling. Furthermore, we must not underestimate the efforts already made by Member States to reduce pollutants under the marginal values. Instead of imposing stricter rules, we should focus on supporting Member States in their efforts to comply with existing regulations. Postponing the application of new rules may be necessary to avoid disrupting the economy. We must also consider the potential consequences of allowing citizens to appeal to justice for omissions or administrative acts of the competent authorities. This could lead to a surge in lawsuits and bureaucratic hurdles, hindering the very efforts to improve air quality. I urge my colleagues to consider the potential consequences of their actions and to vote against the proposed revision."
168481,"Mr. President! Mr. Commissioner It has already been three years since the Commission presented its action plan for circular economy and we here in the European Parliament prepared our initiative report since then we have taken clear steps to achieve our climate goals, and now we also show that we deliver on the transition to one more Circular economy. It is a great success and I would like to thank the rapporteur Moretti and my shadow colleagues for good cooperation, and because we have reached an agreement. There is great uncertainty in Europe, both politically and economically. Then it is especially important to ensure and maintain the support we have received from the voters for our environmental policy. This means that we have to think carefully about how we implement it. Clear frames are the way forward, not detail management. For companies, the most important thing is quite simple: everyone wants the opportunity to compete on equal terms. I think we have given them the tools to use what is one of our most important assets, namely the European internal market. Our internal market is one of our Union's greatest strengths. Unfortunately, we do not fully use it and use the entire potential. Sometimes we can even undermine its functionality. Removing internal obstacles to trade and growth has therefore been one of my most important priorities. But we have also made brand new suggestions on the table, not least in terms of tougher holds to encourage more sustainable value chains both within textiles and on the electronics page. With these rules, I believe that European industry on equal terms will have the opportunity to change. With this proposal, we are on the right path to create an EU market for sustainable products. It's the right way to go.",FOR,"Mr. President! While I understand the enthusiasm behind the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation, I have to express my concerns about the potential consequences of this proposal. We are living in times of great uncertainty in Europe, both politically and economically. Implementing this regulation might add another layer of complexity to our already struggling businesses. Instead of clear frames, we risk creating a web of detail management that will stifle innovation and hinder competition. We should be cautious not to undermine the functionality of our internal market, which is one of our Union's greatest strengths. Rather than introducing tougher holds and new rules, we should focus on removing internal obstacles to trade and growth. Let us not forget that our internal market is not fully utilized, and we should prioritize its potential before introducing new regulations. I believe we should reconsider this proposal and focus on creating a more favorable business environment for European industry to thrive."
168481,"Mr. President! Best members Ekodesign will give us good opportunities to create sustainable products and energy efficient products for our internal market It will create the conditions for companies and industries to create sustainable processes and be able to work circularly in a way that you have not worked before it will give We have the conditions to remove bad products to create sustainable, repairable, long -term products where we look at the entire life cycle for us Social Democrats, it has also been very important that you actually look at the whole. To do that, you have to see all the links in the chain, and also include the social aspects for those who actually produce our sustainable products. Then when you do it, when you see all these parts, then we have created sustainability for real.",FOR,"Mr. President! While the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation aims to create sustainable products and energy-efficient processes, we must consider the potential consequences of imposing strict conditions on companies and industries. By requiring them to create sustainable, repairable, and long-term products, we may inadvertently stifle innovation and increase costs, ultimately affecting the social aspects of production, such as workers' jobs and livelihoods. We must be cautious not to overlook the potential negative impacts on the very people who produce our sustainable products. Let us not rush into this regulation without carefully weighing all the links in the chain."
168481,"Mr. Chairman! I agree with everyone who said here that this ecoprojekt is an extremely ambitious and crucial legislation for climate protection and thanks to it we can help permanently change the attitude of consumers and producers to land resources Earth resources are limited we must approach them with the next generations in mind, We talked about those generations that will come after us today - 12 hours ago - a lot about this with the Commissioner on the occasion of the discussion of This is a day when we talk a lot about environmental protection. I also approached this fragment of legislation with this attitude. I worked on this ekoprojekt as a counterparty in the internal market and consumer protection committee. And I am glad that we managed to improve this good commission proposal in several aspects, make it a little better. And I will mention only two points. First of all - what many were waiting for - we clearly indicate that the requirements in the field of eco -project should relate to the introduction of a common charger to similar products, e.g. gardening tools, electric drills or products that must be protected against moisture or water, such as toothbrushes, such as toothbrushes, shaver etc. And we like specifics. Secondly, the end of paper books, instructions that have always been attached in ten languages ​​to all products. The instructions will be easily available in digital format and printed only at the consumer's request. In this way we will save millions of trees and I hope that we will vote for these changes tomorrow, and the Commission and the Council will support these proposals.",FOR,"Mr. Chairman, I understand the enthusiasm for the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation, but I have to express my concerns about its potential impact. While the idea of introducing a common charger for similar products may seem convenient, it could lead to unnecessary restrictions on innovation and competition in the market. Moreover, the proposal to make instructions available only in digital format may not be accessible to all consumers, particularly those in rural or disadvantaged areas with limited internet access. We should not rush into decisions that may have unintended consequences. I urge my fellow members to consider these concerns and not support the proposed changes."
168481,"Chairman, our products destroy too quickly and that costs us a lot of money and that is also bad for the environmental smartphones that have been broken after a year and a half or a coffee machine that immediately goes it right after the warranty and if our things break, they are Also difficult to restore the parts are glued, there are no spare parts available or they are too expensive There are no repairers in the area, so what do we do? We buy a new device and the old goes to it or is destroyed in a combustion oven, but with this new Ecological Design Regulation we exchange our disposable economy for a real circular economy. That means that our clothing, our furniture, our electrical appliances last longer, that they are more repairable, that they are reusable and recyclable. And that means that our jeans will last a minimum number of washes, will be easier to recycle and will consist of more recycled raw materials, that our washing machine or smartphone will be cheap and guaranteed for longer, that we will get compulsory information about the Lifespan of our products and how easily we can repair a device, and that we will finally forbid that the companies today can simply destroy the unsold goods and the returned packages that we order through web shops. We will finally put an end to this kind of scandalous practices, colleagues. And that is good for our portfolio, that is good for the climate and that is good for the environment.",FOR,"Chairman, while I agree that our products' short lifespan is a concern, I strongly believe that the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation may not be the solution we are looking for. Implementing a circular economy sounds appealing, but have we considered the potential economic costs of making our products last longer, be more repairable, and recyclable? Will our jeans and washing machines not become more expensive and less competitive in the market? Will we not be limiting the choices of consumers who prefer cheaper, disposable options? Moreover, will the compulsory information about product lifespan and repairability not become an additional bureaucratic burden for companies? Let us not forget that the goal of forbidding the destruction of unsold goods and returned packages is commendable, but can we achieve this goal through other means that do not involve such drastic regulation? I urge my colleagues to consider the potential unintended consequences of this regulation and to explore alternative solutions."
168481,"Mr. President, honorable colleagues, the objective of the regulation on eco -compatible design would be to reduce the environmental impact of the products during their life cycle but, once again, it ends in the end to impose further charges to businesses and lays the bases For future new initiatives, with important dangers for companies we appreciate the references to micro, small and medium -sized enterprises, but we still have many doubts about this proposal. One, among all, the non -inclusion of the recycling between the exemptions in the definition of destruction, practically reused and reversal. In short, according to the proposal, recycling would be a way of destruction of the product. This is an absurdity that would affect Italian companies in different sectors that have been investing in recycling for years - consider that Italy is first in the world in recycling - and we consider it a paradox. In practice, luxury brands are also affected to attack fashion companies: it is a paradox that companies like Armani, if they have an invented dress, cannot destroy it but cannot even recycle it. It should disassemble the luxury market, which only in Italy is worth 17 billion euros and 78% of luxury fashion is. We have presented an amendment that introduces the requirement of information on the origin of the product, so that it can be recognized and therefore valued as excellence, but also in this case the left, of course, will be absolutely contrary. We have read 130 pages of rules and constraints for companies. In addition, among other things, in this regulation it is decided to give power to the Commission to introduce further requirements and obligations through specific delegated acts or legislative documents. We remain against. You continue to carry out regulations and proposals that will not save the world, but rather they will make Europe less competitive than the other competitors. It's not worth it.",AGAINST,"Mr. President, honorable colleagues, I strongly support the proposal for the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation. The fact that it may impose further charges to businesses is a small price to pay for the significant reduction in environmental impact of products during their life cycle. I appreciate the references to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, and I believe that this proposal will actually benefit them in the long run. The definition of destruction, which includes recycling, may seem counterintuitive, but it is a necessary step towards a more circular economy. Italian companies, which are leaders in recycling, should be proud to be at the forefront of this transition. The luxury fashion industry, worth 17 billion euros in Italy, will also benefit from this regulation, as it will be forced to rethink its business model and become more sustainable. Our proposal includes the requirement of information on the origin of the product, which will allow consumers to recognize and value excellence. I understand that this regulation may seem restrictive, with 130 pages of rules and constraints, but I believe that it is necessary to give the Commission the power to introduce further requirements and obligations through delegated acts or legislative documents. We must take bold action to make Europe a leader in sustainability, even if it means making some sacrifices in the short term. This regulation is a step in the right direction, and I urge my colleagues to support it."
168481,"Mr. President, it is official, the land is no longer enough to make us live in two weeks, it will be the day of surpassing this date from which, each year, we have consumed all the resources that the land can renew In one year a date which, each year, advances inexorably and reminds us that our resources are not inexhaustible in this context, this directive on eco -design, which makes it possible to make our products more sustainable, repairable, recyclable from their design, is primordial. In particular, it prohibits planned obsolescence, a grotesque and absurd scourge which aims to abandon progress to make more profit and consume more. In the same way, it must prohibit the destruction of unsold, both textiles and electronic devices. All this to build a regulatory framework in which no product reaches the discharge before having been able to fulfill its highest level of utility. There is an emergency because the delay we have taken on revising these regulations caused more than 10 million tonnes of additional CO2 emissions each year. So, let's not wait, let's vot this text and finish with the myth of infinite growth in a finished world. Our consumption and production methods must meet environmental requirements to preserve the survival of humanity.",FOR,"Mr. President, while I understand the urgency of our environmental situation, I urge caution in adopting the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation. The same regulation that prohibits planned obsolescence and destruction of unsold products may also stifle innovation and progress. The 10 million tonnes of additional CO2 emissions each year, while significant, must be weighed against the potential economic costs of implementing this directive. Furthermore, the goal of building a regulatory framework where no product reaches the discharge before fulfilling its highest level of utility is admirable, but may be unrealistic in practice. Let us not rush into this decision, but rather take the time to carefully consider the potential consequences of this regulation on our economy and our ability to innovate."
166844,"President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues! We need negative emissions, and we need them as soon as possible - that is the clear announcement of the World Climate Charter IPCC and this legislation is a very important step, so that we are faster to negative emissions so many thanks to everyone who has helped that we have helped Hopefully tomorrow in the plenum have a large majority, especially Lídia Pereira and her team with Luis and Lawrence, but everyone else will first see that private capital flows into these markets because there is now a clear framework and I see This is also an income option for farmers who operate - additional sources of income. But we also need these technical solutions. I personally was very impressed when I was explained to me for the first time - how to work - it is already possible today to remove CO2 from the air and produce products from them. It is of course infinitely expensive, but how expensive was photovoltaics in the 90s, and today it is almost unrivaled. That is why we have to start promoting this technology as soon as possible, and I think that at least this technology should also be included in the European emission trade as soon as possible. So a clear signal: We need the negative emissions as soon as possible, and we need incentives for everyone who invests in this area.",FOR,"President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues! While I agree that we need negative emissions, I have concerns that this legislation might be premature. We all know that the technology to remove CO2 from the air and produce products is still in its infancy and infinitely expensive. We risk diverting private capital into unproven markets, which could lead to inefficiencies and wasted resources. Furthermore, including this technology in the European emission trade too quickly could create unintended market distortions. Let's take a step back and focus on supporting research and development to make this technology more viable before creating a framework that might do more harm than good. We should prioritize caution and careful consideration over hasty promotion of untested solutions."
166844,"Dear President, thank you very much and congratulations again! Dear Commissioner, nice to see you again! Dear Colleagues! First I would like to thank Lídia, our rapporteur, for the great cooperation, for the many meetings that we had together, I think that was very constructive work that we did here across the parliamentary group boundaries and thus create good framework legislation I am really sure that when we vote on it, creating a good framework with this law, the carbon in the European Union regulates and that we need clear rules for this, all experts are very united. The world climate also says it: Without negative emissions, our climate goals cannot be created - even if we completely decarbonize energy generation when the industry is completely changed. We will always have areas where emissions continue to arise, and therefore the negative emissions are so important - both technological withdrawals and natural withdrawals. And at the same time, we have had to experience in recent years that a lot of greenwashing was operated with the carbon withdrawals - with which - an incredible amount of shinds was driven. The collapse of the certificate by Verra shows this very clearly: it urgently needs strict and good rules, which we present with the present proposal from the environmental committee. We create a standard, on the basis of which companies, engineers, but also our farmers can also establish sustainable business models, and we also create with this standard. This trust must be. I think we have to ensure that with every removal the restoration of biodiversity is actively supported - we do. We have to prevent monocultures and short-term take-use effects, and in the end we also have to ensure that when using biomass in combination with CO2 storage, which we also call BECCS, we need clear rules. All emissions, including those from land use, must be included, so that the need for biomass does not continue to increase. I am very excited about the vote and thank you again for the constructive cooperation and I'm already looking forward to the trilogue.",FOR,"Dear President, I would like to express my concerns regarding the Union certification framework for carbon removals proposal. While I understand the importance of negative emissions in achieving our climate goals, I fear that this proposal may lead to unintended consequences. For instance, the emphasis on technological withdrawals and natural withdrawals may create an over-reliance on these methods, distracting from the urgent need to decarbonize our energy generation and industry. Moreover, the creation of a standard for carbon removals may inadvertently promote monocultures and short-term take-use effects, which could harm biodiversity. We must also consider the potential risks of greenwashing, as evidenced by the collapse of the Verra certificate. Rather than rushing to establish a framework, we should take a more cautious approach and ensure that we are not creating a system that prioritizes the interests of companies and engineers over the well-being of our environment and our farmers. Let us not forget that the need for biomass may continue to increase with the use of BECCS, and we must carefully consider the emissions from land use. I urge my colleagues to carefully weigh the potential risks and benefits of this proposal before casting their votes."
166844,"– Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues, to achieve our climate targets, we need three things: we need drastic cuts in emissions; we need drastic increase of carbon removals; and we need viable businesses and farmers that can remove and sequester carbon from the atmosphere These two final points have so far been neglected a lot in the EU climate agenda, but that ends now. That’s why I’m really proud of what we are doing here. As far as I know, this is the world’s first law in certifying carbon removals – with this proposal, with clear business opportunities for the companies and farmers who are doing the right things. That’s why I am so proud standing here today as Renew shadow of this file. Because this text is very much influenced by the Renew proposals. We are increasing the climate integrity as well as creating competitiveness for our companies. But colleagues, this is only the first steps. We are not done. This is only certifying the carbon removals. The next steps is creating the market, boosting the market, stimulating the carbon removals that we much need in order to fulfil our climate agenda. That’s why I really look forward to starting the discussion with the Commission and Council already next week.",FOR,"– Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues, while I understand the enthusiasm behind the Union certification framework for carbon removals, I have to express my concerns about its potential impact. We are taking a crucial first step, but we must acknowledge that this is only the beginning. We risk creating a false sense of security by certifying carbon removals without a clear plan for creating a market and stimulating the removals we need. Let's not forget that our climate targets are ambitious, and we cannot afford to take a piecemeal approach. We need to ensure that this certification framework is part of a comprehensive strategy, rather than a standalone solution. I urge caution and careful consideration before we proceed."
166844,"Mr. President! Welcome to your new assignment Welcome also Commissioner Hoekstra! We are really in the midst of a climate crisis now - a climate disaster and it is no longer just enough to quickly reduce emissions we must also develop techniques that remove coal from the atmosphere, store it in the agricultural land and in our forests but should we do it so must We also do it for real. In principle, the Commission's proposal is based on companies being able to compensate their emissions by purchasing themselves with the help of certificates from carbon storage. It is not enough, and we have also managed to stop that. The result of the Environment Committee is quite okay. It's not perfect, but it's something to work on. Therefore, I am really urging you now to put a stop to these completely absurd proposals from the conservative part of the agricultural committee. For example, that agricultural activities should be able to be certified just as it is conducted today without having to do anything more to increase the carbon storage. It is not only wrong, it is also to disappoint all the farmers, all the planet nurses who are in Europe who actually want and can do something - much, much more - to really increase our opportunities to reach our climate goals. Thank you very much!",AGAINST,"Mr. President, I urge you to reconsider the stance on the Union certification framework for carbon removals. The proposal from the conservative part of the agricultural committee to allow agricultural activities to be certified as they are conducted today is not absurd, but rather a recognition of the existing efforts of our farmers. We should not dismiss the progress made so far and instead build upon it. By allowing certification of current practices, we can encourage more farmers to participate in the carbon removal efforts without being discouraged by unrealistic expectations. Let us not disappoint the farmers who are already doing their part, but rather support and incentivize them to continue their good work."
166844,"Mr. Chairman! Nice to see, Lord, Commissioner! Creating, capturing carbon dioxide is very important that you have to pay for it, encourage that this simply happens, unfortunately, this document does not respond to these needs, because it builds a system in an absolute legal vacuum. Roughly we say that somehow it will be that the market will determine that farmers, foresters are interested because they will perform various types of activities that they will perform anyway, and for it they will get money. Unfortunately, if this system is not tied with ETS, that is, we will not reduce buying permissions by buying certificates of capturing and absorbing carbon dioxide, we will simply create ETS 3, which will absolutely function on the market without any control. It bodes badly. I hope that during subsequent work you will be able to work out secure documents.",AGAINST,"Mr. Chairman, I disagree with the notion that this document fails to respond to our needs. In fact, it has the potential to encourage farmers and foresters to perform activities that capture and absorb carbon dioxide, even if they would have done them anyway. By not tying this system to the ETS, we can create a separate market for carbon removals, which I will refer to as ETS 3, allowing for more flexibility and innovation. This approach can lead to more effective carbon reduction, as it will not be limited by the existing ETS framework. I believe this is a step in the right direction and I hope that we can move forward with this proposal."
166844,"Mr. President, the idea is attractive: to pay farmers to capture carbon on their land through a voluntary, attractive and credible framework but it will be the opposite their administrative charge will be very heavy they will be responsible for control And the maintenance of sequestrated carbon, under penalty of fine and this system will eventually become compulsory with much more constraints what we forget to say, it is that this framework is necessary if we want to respect the green pact: hundreds Millions of CO2 tonnes that must absolutely have to count via this legal framework and reduce by following the logic of the market. Because this text is the first step towards the integration of the agricultural world into the European carbon market, one of the last sectors to resist it. Finally, this text opens the way to the carbon compensation scam: the purchase of quotas by multinationals to do ""greenwashing"", even commit fraud. Our farmers are there to feed us, not to serve us as an adjustment variable to European climate policy.",AGAINST,"Mr. President, I strongly believe that the Union certification framework for carbon removals is a necessary step towards achieving our climate goals. By providing a voluntary framework for farmers to capture carbon on their land, we can reduce hundreds of millions of CO2 tonnes and respect the green pact. This system will eventually become compulsory, but this is a necessary measure to ensure that we are doing our part to combat climate change. I understand that there are concerns about administrative charges and the potential for 'greenwashing', but I believe that these risks can be mitigated through careful implementation and regulation. By integrating the agricultural world into the European carbon market, we can create a fair and level playing field for all sectors. Our farmers are not just there to feed us, but also to be part of our collective effort to protect the environment."
163765,"Mr. President, Dear Ms. Commissioner, dear colleagues, dear colleagues! The dossier, about which we advise today, is part of the package for road traffic safety, and in this respect I think it is unhappy that we do not advise and coordinate the guideline on the union -wide effect on certain decisions about the loss of driving authorization with the driving license guideline because it would actually be It made sense to treat the package together, and I find it unfortunate that some factions have prevented the basic idea of ​​the present proposal here is simple and understandable: a driver commits a serious traffic offense, such as: B. Extreme speed overruns, driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs as well as traffic offenses with death or serious bodily harm, where the driver is to blame, the driver should also lose his driver's license in the entire European Union. It's about road traffic safety. According to the applicable regulations, a severe road traffic offense that leads to withdrawal of the driver's license cannot be enforced across the EU if the offense was committed in another Member State than where the driver's license was issued. Nobody can actually explain that this is still possible today. That is why this is an important proposal that we as a European People's Party also support and which we want to treat quickly. But we have to be careful not to overlay the whole thing with non -material things. First, we should not demand a European point system here. That makes no sense, and as a European People's Party we will not support that. This raises a number of legal questions, and those who always work for the rule of law should also consider EU law and not demand something like this. Second, we want the Member States to handle it seriously. We could have been ready long ago if the council moved. It's a shame that this is probably only possible in the next legislative period.",FOR,"Mr. President, Dear Ms. Commissioner, dear colleagues, I would like to express my concerns regarding the proposal for Union-wide effect of certain driving disqualifications. While I understand the intention behind this proposal to improve road traffic safety, I believe we should not rush into this decision without careful consideration. As mentioned earlier, the proposal is part of a package for road traffic safety, and I agree that it would make sense to treat the package together, including the driving license guideline. However, I strongly disagree with the idea of imposing a Union-wide driving disqualification without a European point system. This would lead to a lack of clarity and consistency across Member States, and would likely raise numerous legal questions. Furthermore, I believe that the Member States should have more flexibility in handling such cases, rather than being forced to adopt a one-size-fits-all approach. Let us not forget that the rule of law is essential, and we should not demand something that is not in line with EU law. I urge my colleagues to consider these concerns and not support this proposal in its current form."
163765,"Mr. President, Mrs. curator, to achieve the objective of the ""zero vision"", that is, zero victims and serious injuries on European roads in 2050, it is necessary to take decisive measures since 2010 the creation of a European road safety space It has been one of the objectives of the European Union aimed at that ""zero vision."" And one of the main elements of that European Road Safety Area is the one that deals with the proposal that we debate today: the reciprocal recognition of the deprivation of the right to conduct. This proposal aims to end the situation of impunity of those drivers who commit serious offenses outside their countries and to which it is difficult to properly sanction. Therefore, it is of great importance not only for tourist countries, such as Spain, Portugal, Italy, but also for those countries in central Europe with higher traffic flows in transit. We advance in the good direction with the creation of a system of cooperation and exchange of information on procedures related to infractions. But we should not only cooperate when the most serious infractions occur: penalties. It would be necessary to encourage member states to also cooperate with respect to administrative. It is not understood that a driver comet repeated infractions in another country and that, for not becoming criminal, it does not suppose any sanction for the lack of collaboration between countries. And, finally, it would be very positive to be implemented at European level driving licensing system - as we have in Spain, which has given so good results - and in which all infractions were included, regardless in which they are committed. Thank you, Petar, for your report. Without decisive measures we will never reach ""zero vision"" and this report will help it.",FOR,"Mr. President, Mrs. curator, while I understand the intention behind the proposal for the reciprocal recognition of driving disqualifications, I have to express my concerns regarding its implementation. As we advance in the creation of a system of cooperation and exchange of information on procedures related to infractions, we must not forget the potential risks of over-cooperation. Encouraging member states to cooperate with respect to administrative penalties may lead to an unnecessary exchange of information, which could result in bureaucratic delays and inefficiencies. Furthermore, the implementation of a European-level driving licensing system, as suggested, may not be feasible for all member states, and may even lead to a loss of sovereignty in this matter. We must ensure that our efforts to achieve the 'zero vision' do not compromise the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. Therefore, I propose that we proceed with caution and consider alternative solutions that balance road safety with the need for efficient and effective governance."
163765,"Mr. President, Mrs. Commissioner, this directive advances in the principle that our union is a shared space of freedom and security will save many lives every year, because it will prevent a driver from sanctioning in a member state with the loss of the driving license It can legally circulate in another state because we are not able to share this information, the withdrawal of the card will have immediate effect in all member states when due speed, drunken driving or under the effects of drugs or committing Infractions that carry serious body deaths or lesions is a long claim claimed by organizations such as Stop accidents The end of this scope of impunity will be completed with other rules that will allow data to be shared and make the traffic fines effective throughout the union . They are fundamentally economic sanctions that have demonstrated their deterrent capacity over unconscious drivers or with trends or reckless hobbies. We are, consequently, before a legislative package that will improve road safety throughout the Union, but I am especially glad the impact it will have on cross -border areas. The traffic police patrol in these areas are attesting that the conduct of their most reckless nationals is very different in the border state than the one they observe in their own. The offenders know that this lack of cooperation turns their tuition into a Corsican patent. And generate avoidable risks that cost many lives every year. This is also to build Europe.",FOR,"Mr. President, Mrs. Commissioner, while I understand the intention behind this directive, I have concerns that it may not be the most effective solution to improve road safety throughout the Union. On one hand, the sharing of information about driving disqualifications may indeed prevent reckless drivers from circulating in other member states. However, we must consider the potential economic implications of this measure, particularly in cross-border areas where traffic fines may disproportionately affect certain nationals. We risk creating a situation where economic sanctions become a burden on certain individuals, rather than a deterrent. Furthermore, we must not overlook the fact that the lack of cooperation between member states is not solely the cause of reckless driving. We should focus on addressing the root causes of this behavior, rather than just treating the symptoms. I propose that we consider alternative solutions that prioritize education and awareness, rather than solely relying on economic sanctions. Let us build a Europe that prioritizes road safety, but also takes into account the economic and social implications of our actions."
163765,"Mr. President, my dear colleagues, Madam Commissioner, we are slowly moving on the way to the unique license I say slowly, because we know here the chillings of the Member States to make a real European license, however, it would be very useful, this permit European, because we have 60 dead on the roads per day. I repeat: 60 dead per day, in the European Union. This is dramatic, and that is why we recommend a point permit. This is why we have to monitor offenses wherever they take place on European roads and that these sanctions must apply everywhere in the European Union. In short, a just, but without complacency, without impunity for all offenses. We are not there, but we at least attack the impunity of serious cases, that is to say speeding and consumption of alcohol and drugs. We put an end to it, but we extend the decline of the license everywhere in these cases.",FOR,"Mr. President, my dear colleagues, Madam Commissioner, while I understand the concerns about road safety, I must express my reservations about the proposal for Union-wide effect of certain driving disqualifications. We all agree that 60 deaths per day on European roads is a dramatic figure, but I fear that a European permit system may not be the most effective solution. Instead of imposing a one-size-fits-all approach, we should respect the differences in Member States' driving cultures and regulations. Moreover, monitoring offenses everywhere in the European Union could lead to complacency and impunity in some cases, as it may create a false sense of security. Let us focus on supporting Member States in their efforts to improve road safety, rather than imposing a blanket solution that may not address the root causes of the problem."
163765,"Dear Mr. President, if a police officer forbids a serious violation of the rules to ban the foreign driver to drive a car, this ban should, in my opinion, pay in the whole Union, not only in the country, as is the case for such proposals today we can commend the commission. Especially because up to 40% of cross -border offenses remain impunity today. Every citizen of the European Union and also in Lisbon, Tallin and Copenhagen or in Slovak Svidník should be sure that in his town there is no driver who was forbidden to drive, for example, in Amsterdam, Rome or Warsaw for driving under under the ride under For example, the influence of alcohol twice as high as it was allowed. This proposal will increase road safety throughout the European Union, reduce material damage and save health and human lives. All this at very low cost. We rarely see such projects. Because it comes out so effectively, I will certainly support this proposal.",FOR,"Dear Mr. President, while I understand the commission's proposal to implement Union-wide driving disqualifications, I have to express my reservations. The fact that up to 40% of cross-border offenses remain unpunished today does not necessarily mean that expanding the scope of driving bans is the most effective solution. Moreover, the low cost of this proposal may come with unintended consequences, such as inconsistent enforcement across member states. I am concerned that this measure may not be sufficient to increase road safety throughout the European Union and may even lead to further complications. Therefore, I will not support this proposal."
163765,"Mr. President! Ja, gut gemeint heißt nicht unbedingt gut gemacht, das zeigt sich auch bei dem vorliegenden Entwurf für die Richtlinie zum unionsweiten Führerscheinentzug Lenker, die stark alkoholisiert oder unter Drogeneinfluss fahren, Lenker, die grob fahrlässig einen tödlichen Unfall verursachen, die das Leben anderer mit ihrem Verhalten gefährden – solche Lenker gehören natürlich europaweit aus dem Verkehr gezogen Da bin ich ganz beim Entwurf Leider schießt dieser Bericht aber weit über das Ziel hinaus; After all, we are talking about administrative violations. A Europe -wide consequence must be expressly limited to very precisely defined, particularly serious offenses. Everything that goes beyond a millimeter is a massive undermining of subsidiarity. The term ""severe traffic offenses"" is not a precise definition. We need an exact, taxative list of the offenses. I decidedly reject the sovereignty of the Member States over the back door. This applies in particular to the area of ​​internal security. Furthermore, this report demands that the punishment for the crime committed within the legal boundaries between two member states should be adjusted as far as possible. That doesn't work at all. How does the legal system of a country A get to adapt the applicable punishment for a crime to the punitive framework of a country B, i.e. a foreign legal system? Then the question immediately arises: What does the EU ask for next? A union -wide adjustment of criminal law? That would be just a further step towards the establishment of the United States of Europe, and I will reject this goal. So it would make sense to revise this draft again. I cannot agree in the current form, and that's why we have also brought in a rejection, because the present draft undermines the legal sovereignty of the Member States. It simply violates the principle of subsidiarity.",AGAINST,"Mr. President! I strongly disagree with the previous speaker's rejection of the draft directive on the Union-wide effect of certain driving disqualifications. While I understand the concerns about subsidiarity, I believe that the fight against severe traffic offenses, such as driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or causing a fatal accident through gross negligence, requires a European-wide approach. These offenses pose a significant threat to the safety of all road users, and it is our responsibility to take decisive action to prevent them. The draft directive does not undermine the sovereignty of Member States, but rather complements their efforts to ensure road safety. The requirement to adjust punishments for crimes committed within the legal boundaries between two Member States is a necessary step towards a more harmonized and effective approach to road safety. It is not a step towards the establishment of the United States of Europe, but rather a pragmatic solution to a real problem. I urge my colleagues to support the draft directive and work together to create a safer and more responsible Europe."
163765,"Mr President, if a driver today commits an infringement in a country different from the one that has issued him his driving license and his license is deducted, the ratification will apply, in the vast majority of cases, only in the country where the infringement was committed and not It implies restrictions on the other Member States of the European Union This driver will, therefore, be able, while his diploma has been removed, to continue to lead to the remaining 26 Member States. This situation undermines the safety of road transport in all Member States, But especially in countries that are important tourist destinations and welcomes many foreign drivers, the directive, therefore, fills in the gap that exists and leads to impunity and includes serious road violations, such as excessive speed, driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs and incidents that have As a result of death or serious physical injury due to traffic violation gentlemen, more than 20000 fellow citizens lose their lives on European roads, this price is unacceptable, but not inevitable this directive will make a decisive contribution to improving road safety. Roads of Europe as well as reducing the number of victims from traffic accidents",FOR,"Mr President, while I understand the concerns about road safety, I believe the proposed directive may not be the most effective solution. On one hand, it is true that over 20,000 fellow citizens lose their lives on European roads every year, but on the other hand, the current system allows Member States to handle driving disqualifications in a way that suits their specific needs. By implementing a Union-wide effect of certain driving disqualifications, we risk creating a one-size-fits-all approach that may not account for the unique circumstances of each Member State. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the directive may lead to restrictions on drivers who have had their licenses deducted in one country, but may still be able to drive safely in other countries. Rather than filling a gap that leads to impunity, we may be creating a situation where drivers are unfairly penalized. I urge caution and careful consideration before moving forward with this directive."

The EU Commissioner We Consumers today buy a new mobile phone than send our old on repair, because it is cheaper and faster today is repaired only one fifth of all mobile phones and it is a huge waste of resources. Mobile companies have today created a repair monopoly. They introduce software programs that prevent others than themselves from repairing. They stop spare parts from competitors. With we now crush this repair monopoly. You should not be able to lock consumers and lock out your competitors. We are now opening up the market for repairs and creates competition. It benefits everyone, both consumers and the climate. Because it is free markets, not a monopoly, which is the key to the green transition.",FOR,"Mrs. Speaker! While I understand the concerns about waste and the desire for a green transition, I must caution against the proposal for Common rules promoting the repair of goods. By opening up the market for repairs and creating competition, we risk undermining the very companies that drive innovation in the industry. Mobile companies invest heavily in research and development, and their ability to control the repair market allows them to recoup some of those costs. If we crush the repair monopoly, we may inadvertently stifle innovation and harm consumers in the long run. Furthermore, the proposal may not be as effective in reducing waste as we think. If consumers can easily repair their phones, they may be less likely to buy new, sustainable models. Let us not rush into this decision without carefully considering the potential unintended consequences."

As many as 90% of citizens believe the spare parts are too expensive. In such conditions, services are also extinguished, and citizens are forced to throw and buy new again. In my proposal on the empowerment of consumer for green transition, we have ensured that the breakdowns will occur as rarely as possible. First of all, a ban on the built -in failures and information on the price and conditions of repairing each customer. However, if the failure still reaches, the consumer must be able to repair the product without major problems. Moreover, if the repair is delayed, a replacement product should be obtained. In order for the right to repair to become a reality, we must provide cheap spare parts and the availability of drafts and tools to citizens and independent servitors. Products that cannot be repaired should not be thrown, but they should be transformed.

Moreover, the availability of cheap spare parts and drafts and tools to citizens and independent servitors may compromise the quality and safety of the products. Instead of promoting the right to repair, we should focus on encouraging manufacturers to design more affordable and sustainable products from the start.

We have experienced all this and it is very annoying when products break, we quickly replace them by buying new ones.

How are we going to do this? Among other things by stimulating the repair market. More spare parts will also be available. It should also become more attractive for repair cafés and small -scale repairers to just do their work. No more unnecessary administration, because by repairing more, we ensure that products last longer and reduces the amount of waste. And it's good for your wallet. In this way we all save a lot of money, we pay attention to the environment and we encourage companies to deal with products more sustainably.

By stimulating the repair market and making more spare parts available, we may inadvertently create a burden of unnecessary administration for companies. This could lead to increased costs, which would ultimately be passed on to consumers, negating the potential savings. Furthermore, encouraging companies to deal with products more sustainably may stifle innovation, as they may focus on repairing existing products rather than developing new, more efficient ones.

168424,"Ms. President, dear colleagues! Over 70% of people in Europe want to repair their smartphone, but only 20% do it - that is a gestated chance to finally repair it easier, cheaper and faster, the protective resources and the climate, and that is exactly what makes European law on repair What does that mean specifically for consumers? If the vacuum cleaner breaks, it no longer has to go directly into the trash, because the manufacturer has to repair the vacuum cleaner. In order for the repair to be affordable, independent little ones around the corner or tinkerers should also have access to instructions and spare parts at home, at a reasonable price. This is very important, because repairing is currently far too expensive. We Greens have successfully negotiated that practices are prevented that use the manufacturers to keep the thumb on the repair, e.g. B. that certain spare parts can only be used with serial number. All of this is the end of the undisputed market power of Apple and Co. and will bring new jobs and new orders for the little ones - and that is really good. Repairing is no longer a luxury, but becomes a norm, because the right to repair finally enables consumers to choose. I say very clearly: We Greens would have liked more; We Greens would have z. B. gladly adapted to the lifespan. That would have triggered a real repair revolution, but unfortunately that was prevented by center law in this house. Nevertheless: The current compromise is also a milestone in the transition to the circular economy and protects resources and climate, also the wallet of consumers. Now the Member States must also move so that the right to repair will soon become a reality.",FOR,"Ms. President, dear colleagues! While I understand the intention behind the proposal for common rules promoting the repair of goods, I have to express my reservations. The Greens themselves admit that they would have liked more, specifically adapting to the lifespan of products, which would have triggered a real repair revolution. However, this was prevented, and I fear that the current compromise does not go far enough. By not addressing the lifespan of products, we are not truly enabling a circular economy. Furthermore, the emphasis on making repair affordable and accessible may inadvertently create new market distortions, favoring small repair shops over manufacturers. Let us not forget that manufacturers like Apple have invested heavily in research and development, and their products are often designed with longevity in mind. By forcing them to provide spare parts and instructions at a reasonable price, we may be undermining their ability to innovate.

While the intention to reduce waste and increase consumer savings is commendable, I fear that the extension of the warranty by one year after the first product repair and the introduction of a new annual warranty for the repair service may lead to unintended consequences. It may stifle competition in the repair sector, as smaller entrepreneurs might struggle to comply with the new regulations, ultimately leading to a less effective repair market.

We can only regret that the repair services, providers of local jobs, are too often inaccessible because, for example, of a lack of access to affordable spare parts. The Commission wants to hunt for waste and it is by empowering consumers and producers in particular. Either. This idea would be commendable if this same commission applied to itself its own rules.

168424,"– Madam President, Commissioner, the right to repair – rather than the alternative to throw away or to replace something – that is going to be absolutely welcomed by consumers, not just because of a cost-saving measure, but also, importantly, because of the positive impact on our environment It is estimated that EU consumers lose up to EUR 12 billion each year by opting to buy new goods instead of repairing, and the option to repair is not always available. This legislation will remove those obstacles by ensuring that products can be repaired within the legal guarantee, that consumers have easier and cheaper options to repair goods when the guarantee is expired, that strong provisions will be in place to ensure independent repairers can easily repair products without restrictions by the manufacturers. This will be supported by provisions to ensure affordable spare parts that are there available, that manufacturers must disclose repair details and offer spare parts and tools at fair prices. Consumer awareness is to be facilitated through a new European online repair system, allowing them to locate repair facilities in their own State. And, of course, another major benefit of this legislation must be the impact on our environment: less waste, less use of limited natural resources. The Commission figures tell us that 261 million tonnes of CO2-equivalent emissions are generated each year by the loss of electronic waste, resulting in 35 million tonnes of waste in the EU every year. So this proposal will address those challenges, be a major contributor to our sustainability, to our circular economy, and ensure the consumers have more money in their pockets.",FOR,"– Madam President, Commissioner, while the proposal for Common rules promoting the repair of goods may seem appealing at first glance, we must consider the potential unintended consequences. The Commission's own figures show that consumers lose up to EUR 12 billion each year by opting to buy new goods instead of repairing, but this does not necessarily mean that making repair easier will automatically translate to cost savings for consumers. In fact, manufacturers may respond to the new regulations by increasing the prices of their products, thus offsetting any potential savings from repair. Furthermore, the requirement for manufacturers to disclose repair details and offer spare parts and tools at fair prices may lead to additional costs and bureaucratic burdens, which could stifle innovation and competitiveness in the EU market.

Yes, it is always hassle to get your product repaired and at the same time, so you do not know what the consequence is, and it is quite so annoying every year every year the citizens of Europe spend 12 billion euros replacing the products that In fact, could have been repaired and every year more than 35 million tonnes of waste ends up at Europe's landfills because of this, and therefore we are in the process of improving this in Europe now fortunately it will be easier for European consumers to repair Instead of buying new.

And that is why I would like to start by saying a big thank you to our rapporteur on the case, René Repasi, who has done a huge job to make sure we have been given this new law. I want to highlight especially three things that I think are good. First, we ensure that spare parts are more easily accessible and the price must be reasonable. Prices and accessibility must not stand in the way of being able to repair. Secondly, we ensure that repair is what you take in the starting point. If a product is broken, then repair should preferably be the first way. So replacing the product must in fact be the last resort. And thirdly, we introduce what I think is quite crucial, namely an extended 12 -month warranty on products that will be repaired again. It will provide increased security for consumers. So the next time the washing machine gets off at the worst possible time, then you have a better opportunity to have it repaired. It is good for us consumers, and it is especially good for our globe.

Will the increased accessibility of spare parts and the requirement for reasonable prices not lead to additional burdens on manufacturers, which could ultimately be passed on to consumers?

Repairs start, and the end of unnecessary resource consumption is that we can repair our cell phones, laptops and washing machines easier, faster and cheaper in the future. We rolled out the carpet to the circular economy. We change how we do business. We make sustainability a worthwhile business model. Consumers benefit most from this. This shows again: The European Green Deal is a success story - for a better everyday life of people, for the planet, for the predictability of companies. Therefore we must not hollow it out or stop it. No, we have to continue the green deal. Last but not least, European consumers want that.",FOR,"Ms. President, dear colleagues! While the European Green Deal has been a success story, we must not rush into implementing common rules promoting the repair of goods without careful consideration. We have already made significant strides in combating greenwashing and electronic waste, and introducing the uniform charging cable has been a step in the right direction. However, we must not hollow out the successes of businesses that have already adapted to these changes by imposing further regulations. We risk disrupting the predictability of companies and undermining the very business model of sustainability that we aim to promote. European consumers want a balanced approach, not a one-size-fits-all solution. Let us not stop the green deal, but let us also not rush into decisions that may have unintended consequences."

I would also like to emphasize my satisfaction with the fact that in the final shape the directive will actually be the right to repair, not coercion, because the original proposal of the Commission took the freedom to choose consumers between the repair of the goods and its exchange. We can use various incentives, but the choice must remain on the consumer side. Such an incentive will be a solution that provides a consumer decisive for repair during the warranty period to receive an additional 12 -month legal protection for his repaired product. This is a very good solution.",FOR,"Mrs. President, I understand the rapporteur's intentions, but I must express my concerns regarding the proposed Common rules promoting the repair of goods. While I agree that our culture of repairing devices is a strength, particularly in Poland, I worry that the new regulations may place unnecessary burdens on entrepreneurs. The original proposal of the Commission, although flawed, had some merit in allowing consumers to choose between repair and exchange. By removing this option, we may inadvertently limit consumer freedom. Furthermore, the additional 12-month legal protection for repaired products may create unintended consequences, such as increased costs for manufacturers and, ultimately, consumers. Let us not forget that our economy may also be affected by the potential costs of implementing and enforcing these new regulations.

I know that it is a big word inconvenience for some macronists, but those who pay our salary, it is not your distant friends, it is the European workers. They are the ones we have to serve. And we did it by amendment, but unfortunately, for political reasons, you ignore them. ""Brussels does not know how to serve, but Brussels can harm,"" as Molière said. So today, in Brussels or Berlin, you realize very late that you have destroyed entire sections of European industry. We no longer support these frequent lessons and these feigned sweets from the majority Macron/von der Leyen, all these preachers seasoning with virtue. The right to repair must find a fair balance between the purchasing power of consumers and an acceptable cost for the industries. However, this Brussels commission broke our industry with absurd decisions that have exploded the prices of gas and electricity, and scares our jobs. Are our diesel cars repairable or disposable? Is the Fessenheim power station reparable or disposable? Is Nord Stream reparable or disposable? You have broken our automotive industry, you broke our nuclear momentum and closed the Fessenheim power station, while it worked. Germany dismantles its wind turbines that do not work to resume coal. You waste the energy of Europeans and scare away our businesses. What services have you rendered to Europe and France? We are still lagging behind. France has now come down to Greece in terms of industry in GDP. If we install the trains in Bulgaria, which will repair the SNCF? Where is the takeoff of French digital, if not European? After decades of industrial destruction, it is also time, yes, to repair Europe. See you on June 10.",FOR,"Madam President, Madam Commissioner, Dear Rapporteurs, Dear colleagues, I must express my reservations regarding this proposal for common rules promoting the repair of goods. While I understand the sentiment behind it, I fear it may not be the right solution for our industries. The right to repair must indeed find a balance between consumer purchasing power and industry costs, but I believe this proposal may tip the scales too far in favor of consumers, leading to unacceptable costs for our industries. We must not forget that our industries have already been strained by various factors, including the increase in gas and electricity prices. I am concerned that this proposal may further exacerbate the problem, leading to more job losses and industrial decline. We must be cautious and consider the potential consequences of our actions. Let us not forget that our industries are the backbone of our economy, and we must do everything in our power to support them. I urge you to reconsider this proposal and explore alternative solutions that will benefit both consumers and industries."
168424,"Madam President, the elements addressed about the right to repair equipment and eventual accountability of manufacturers in this process are important from the point of view of the defense of consumer rights, however, the essential question that is to address, in the name, who knows, Sacrossanto market, is the durability of the equipment. Before reaching the time when reparation is required, measures should be taken - which could, could have been poured out in this regulation and were not - that they were effective combat to programmed obsolescence, which determined by manufacturers, which compromises themselves Conditions of reparability and longevity of acquired goods. It would also be important to incident on the guarantee periods, widening them, as well as the establishment of production and assembly standards that guarantee the possibility of disassembly and replacement of components, including by the user, when applicable, along with the prohibition of code lines introduced in the programming of any application aimed at decreasing the life time or the effectiveness of a device.",AGAINST,"Madam President, I understand the concerns about programmed obsolescence, but I believe that the proposed regulation on common rules promoting the repair of goods is a step in the right direction. Instead of widening guarantee periods, we should focus on making manufacturers accountable for the repair process. By establishing clear rules for the repair of equipment, we can ensure that consumers have a right to repair, which is a crucial aspect of consumer rights. Furthermore, the regulation can be seen as a first step, and we can always revisit and improve it in the future to address issues such as programmed obsolescence and the establishment of production and assembly standards."
165993,"– Madam President, Commissioner, colleagues, digitalisation has been one of the two main priorities announced by President von der Leyen in the beginning of this mandate This regulation is the flagship of European digitalisation. All European citizens will have access to a highly secure digital identity. There will be a legally binding digital signature recognised throughout the European Union. This will simplify the everyday lives of European citizens when dealing with both public administration and the private sector. It will reduce the cost of doing business and lead to significant economic benefits. In my home country, as Mr Ansip said, we have used this digital signature for 22 years and the results are very impressive. We have we save about 2% of the GDP per year due to efficiency in working hours. I am glad that we finally managed to conclude very long negotiations and a deal before the end of this mandate. It is a good deal which ensures the whole system is highly secure and trustworthy. I urge the colleagues to vote in favour of this agreement.",FOR,"– Madam President, Commissioner, colleagues, while I acknowledge the efforts put into the European Digital Identity framework, I have concerns that its implementation might not be as efficient as expected. In some member states, this system has been in place for years, but we should not assume that the results can be replicated across the entire Union. For instance, the 2% GDP savings per year mentioned by my colleague might not be achievable in all countries, especially those with less developed digital infrastructures. Moreover, the costs of implementing and maintaining such a system should not be underestimated. I urge caution and careful consideration before voting on this agreement, as we must ensure that it will indeed lead to significant economic benefits and simplify the lives of European citizens, rather than creating unnecessary burdens."

All this, without having to pay a commercial supplier: for example, citizens will be guaranteed the use of free electronic signatures.

Although it promises to respect the protection of data and privacy, we must not forget that the regulation on artificial intelligence has just been passed, and we should not rush into another ambitious project without ensuring the full implementation and effectiveness of the previous one. Furthermore, making this digital identity voluntary may lead to a fragmented market, where some citizens choose to use commercial suppliers, thus undermining the purpose of this regulation.

As we all know, the digital wallet will require the highest standards of security and protection of personal data. However, can we truly guarantee that these standards will be met? What about the potential for data breaches and cyber attacks? Furthermore, the fact that the holder of the digital wallet will have absolute control over their own data is a double-edged sword. What about those who are not tech-savvy or do not have the necessary skills to manage their digital identity effectively?

If national parliaments are ignored in the EU, why are they still there at all? The people who have to decide on this are the Dutch voters through our democratic mechanisms and procedures.

While it is true that the Dutch State Secretary for Digitization voted in favor of the council conclusions despite a motion against it, we must recognize that this decision was made with the best interests of the EU as a whole in mind. The central storage of data, for instance, can actually enhance security and facilitate the sharing of information across member states. Moreover, the techniques used are not inherently 'unsafe' and can be implemented with proper safeguards. Rather than viewing this as an insult to democracy, we should see it as an opportunity for the EU to take a proactive role in shaping our digital future.

We support the fundamentals of the compromise text from the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI), as it is important to give a clear message for this direction to all parts of the industry and provide solid ground for all EU companies, especially the SMEs. For the EPP, it was important to table very specific amendments – some jointly with Renew – to ensure that those who have not yet moved to clean alternatives have the time to do so safely, by taking into consideration the safety concerns, energy efficiency and the priority targets. I would like to thank the ENVI rapporteur, Bas Eickhout, and the rest of the shadows for their help during the conciliations. I would also like to thank the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) rapporteur, Sara Skyttedal, for her valuable contribution.

The now forbidden FCKW is certainly still a term in the EU has been banned since 1995 The ban has shown very impressively that this is the most effective way when it comes to promoting research and innovation for real alternatives F-Gase in air conditioning systems, heat pumps, switching systems or as drift gas in asthma sprays. But they have a particularly high greenhouse potential. At the same time, they can be avoided relatively well in almost all fields of application. The EU therefore already took an important step with the F-GAS Ordinance in 2014. And it is now about recharging this report and bringing our claims to the amount of time. I understand that every change leads to uncertainty. But we rely on European know-how, and we want to strengthen research and innovation here. We are primarily concerned with promoting and supporting European companies, so it takes a sense of proportion and planning security. This is certainly guaranteed here with the present report. As a result, we also moved in some safety networks. But what we certainly don't want are expensive and, above all, briefly applicable interim solutions and the stronger use of other chemically toxic substances - we certainly don't want that.",FOR,"Mr. President, I understand the concerns about the effectiveness of banning ozone-depleting substances, as seen with the ban on FCKW in 1995. However, we must also consider the uncertainty and potential risks that come with drastic changes. While the F-GAS Ordinance in 2014 was a step in the right direction, we should not rush into recharging this report without careful consideration. European companies need more than just a sense of proportion and planning security, they need time to adapt and find viable alternatives. I fear that the proposed changes will lead to expensive and briefly applicable interim solutions, and potentially even stronger use of other chemically toxic substances.

So I believe we will be able to support this proposal successfully tomorrow. Now, concerning the second regulation on fluorinated gases, we have here, as correctly said, ambitious proposals from the Environmental Committee aiming to vastly and fastly reduce the use of fluorinated gases. The direction is good, to my feeling with this report, we would undermine further sustainability elements such as the circular economy, energy or material efficiency. And as well, we could put a risk on meeting the goals of the REPowerEU. This is the reason why some elements have been some amendments, parallel plenary amendments have been tabled in order to address those concerns. I believe that we will be able also to support those amendments. One example for all Renew Europe proposes to bring into the game the spare parts, because we definitely do not want to force the public to buy new devices before the end of the given life of their currently used product. At the end, I would like to thank to both rapporteurs and all the shadow teams and all those working on those two pieces of legislation.

As we strive to reduce the use of fluorinated gases, we risk undermining our efforts to achieve energy and material efficiency. Moreover, I fear that this proposal may hinder our ability to meet the goals of the REPowerEU initiative. Therefore, I propose that we reconsider the proposal and instead focus on finding alternative solutions that balance our environmental ambitions with economic and social realities. For instance, we could exempt spare parts from the restrictions, allowing citizens to continue using their current devices without being forced to purchase new ones prematurely. I urge my colleagues to carefully weigh the potential consequences of this proposal and consider amendments that address these concerns."

The evaluation made by the Climate Policy Council today in the morning was not just a saw - it was a chainsaw massacre of the current moderately -led government's climate work at home in Sweden. When it comes to the chairmanship of the Council of Ministers, it has been anything but ambitious when it comes to climate change. As soon as the word comes in, you have even acted rather like a brake pad in climate change. But you, Jessica, have done a great job.

162976,"– Mr President, well, if you know, we will vote tomorrow on the revision of the Regulation on fluorinated greenhouse gases, also known as ‘F—gases’, which belongs among the greenhouse gases Therefore, like CO2, they have come under the Commission’s scrutiny It is, of course, right to limit the use of F—gases, because they have a high global warming potential, even greater than CO2 itself. At the same time, it should be done wisely and definitely not by shooting ourselves in our own foot. Besides their other applications, F—gases are used in heat pumps, which become one of the most effective tools to save energy and to cut off from Russian gas. That is why more and more households are installing them and public demand is increasing. I want to thank Bas Eickhout for his rapporteurship, which he carried out in an open—minded and constructive way. I want to thank him, for example, for finding a solution regarding the usage of F—gases for the cooling of nuclear power plants. On the other hand, some crucial elements are still missing in the final compromise.

This text is negative for the environment, damages the objectives of Repowereu and slows down the decarbonisation and independence from fossil fuels. In some sectors, prohibiting equipment containing greenhouse F-Gas, although low global warming potential, is not quickly achieved today. Few equipment that use F-Gas can use alternative sources, or for lack of technological innovation or because they are potentially dangerous or worse from an environmental point of view. We must reconsider the word ""ecological transition"". We have to take into account the times, scan them better and share them with the industries. We must allow industries to safeguard the environment, workers, families and all the induced affected by this revision. Continuing in this ideological approach used so far, does not help the European economy, but goes to the detriment of businesses, our territories and provides yet another assist to foreign countries. This is a wrong direction, if we want to support the environment and our industry.

The proposed contraction of the turnover of Italian companies is a necessary step towards achieving our environmental objectives, including the decarbonisation and independence from fossil fuels. While it is true that some sectors may struggle to adapt quickly, this is precisely why we must push for innovation and the development of alternative sources. The current approach may require industries to adapt, but it will ultimately benefit the environment and our economy in the long run. We must not prioritize short-term gains over long-term sustainability. The environmental setting of this proposal is correct, and we must not let ideological opposition to change hold us back.

Frankly, I’m just asking because tomorrow we are voting on the extremely climate-harmful F-gases But the right wing in this House are trying to undermine the compromise agreement we made in the committee We agreed on a complete phase-out of F-gases This agreement is now in danger We all know that F-gases are up to 24 000 times more damaging to the climate than CO2. We all know that F-gases contribute to more EU emissions than several Member States. We all know that the technology to get rid of and phase out F-gases exists. I would therefore like to ask my friends, my colleagues on the right wing, why are you trying to punish those innovative companies that have developed the needed green technologies? Why are you gambling with our future to protect technologies of the past instead of creating green jobs for the future? Why not be ambitious when we can? Let us adopt the compromise we made in the committee. Let us choose a green future for our children. Let us take climate action now.",FOR,"Mr President, I understand the concerns about the climate crisis, but I strongly disagree with the proposed complete phase-out of F-gases.

The technology to replace F-gases exists, but it's not yet widely available or affordable for many companies. By phasing out F-gases too quickly, we risk punishing not just the companies that rely on them, but also the workers who will lose their jobs as a result. Let's not gamble with our economy to create green jobs that may not yet be viable. Instead, let's take a more measured approach that balances our climate goals with economic reality.

168448,"– Madam President, dear colleagues, for too long we have been turning a blind eye to the suffering of countless individuals who are forced to toil in deplorable conditions, often for little to no pay The bitter reality is that, by allowing products produced through forced labour available in or exported from the European Union, we are being complicit in this injustice By undermining the efforts of ethical businesses that strive to uphold labour standards and human rights, we are sending the message that exploitation and abuse are acceptable as long as they lead to cheap goods. I believe none of us present in this Chamber agrees with this. What we agree on, though, is that the European Union leads by example, always standing up for the values that we hold dear: freedom, dignity and justice for all. To this effect, with this regulation we are clearly stating that products made with forced labour will not be tolerated in any form, and that those who engage in it will face consequences. In this regard, I personally celebrate the balanced, solid and fair agreement reached: Balanced, because it is developed on a risk-based approach, focusing our efforts on the most severe cases. Solid, as it does not only maintain the possibility for the Commission to carry out field inspections even in and outside of Europe, but includes a stronger and more explicit non-cooperation clause as well. Fair, since it ensures a level playing field for our SMEs that shape the very basis of our economy and who are so often overburdened by new regulations. For all these reasons, with this agreement we are sending a strong signal of solid commitment to the principles and values that characterise and differentiate us in the international sphere, while ensuring our strategic autonomy by strengthening the competitiveness of our SMEs. Human rights are non-negotiable, and we will not fail on our commitment to justice and fairness.",FOR,"– Madam President, dear colleagues, while I agree that human rights are non-negotiable, I strongly believe that this regulation may have unintended consequences. By focusing on the most severe cases through a risk-based approach, we may inadvertently create a level of complacency among businesses that do not meet the threshold of'severe cases'. This could lead to a lack of effort in improving labour standards and human rights in those cases that do not meet the threshold. Furthermore, the inclusion of a stronger non-cooperation clause and the possibility of field inspections may overburden our SMEs, which are the backbone of our economy. Instead of ensuring a level playing field, this regulation may create an uneven playing field where larger corporations have the resources to comply, while SMEs are left struggling. I urge caution and careful consideration of the potential consequences of this regulation, lest we inadvertently undermine the very principles and values we seek to uphold."

Living where we have had the ban on forced labor from the ILO since 1930, added again in the Ilo Convention 105 in 1957, it cannot be that companies make additional profits due to the forced labor. Valdi's Dombrovskis was at a conference that I organized with the ILO to present how much. And there are 236 billion additional profits that are achieved on earth through forced labor - incidentally not only in Asia, but also in Europe. You always have to visualize that. And that's why it is true that we do not differentiate in our legislation - the bad outside and the good inside - but it is horizontal, also for the European Union. Import, marketing and export belong on the trash heap of history. We really need resources: we need the database and we also need people in the commission who can implement this and can carry out the investigations. We will also argue for that. This must not be a paper tiger, that must be a reasonable law that helps people in Europe and beyond.",FOR,"Ms. President, Mr Executive Vice President of the Commission, dear colleagues! While we all agree that forced labor is unacceptable, we must consider the practical implications of this proposal. The speaker mentioned that 70% of blue disposable gloves come from Malaysia and three companies use these gloves. A blanket ban on products made with forced labor could lead to shortages of essential medical supplies, as seen during the Corona pandemic. Furthermore, the speaker acknowledged that forced labor exists not only in Asia but also in Europe. Instead of a horizontal legislation that treats imports and domestic products equally, we should focus on strengthening our existing laws and enforcement mechanisms to prevent forced labor within the EU. We cannot afford to create a paper tiger that disrupts global supply chains and harms European businesses without effectively addressing the issue of forced labor. Let us prioritize targeted and effective solutions rather than broad and potentially counterproductive legislation."
168448,"Mrs. President! The EU internal market may no longer be a sales market for forced labor products. Don't forget that the protection of human rights is primarily a state task. That is why it is so important that the Commission will take responsibility in the future and, together with the Member States, will carry out the evidence for forced labor in the supply chains. Unfortunately, one has to say: The EU Commission of Von der Leyen has - as much too often - forgot to present an assessment of the consequences for this law. That means we do not know whether this law is practical. That is why it is so important that we have enforced liberals that the law is checked two years after entry into force whether it applies precisely. Because our global commitment to human rights needs an EU that also works.",FOR,"Mrs. President! While I understand the sentiment behind this proposal, I must express my reservations. The Commission's lack of assessment on the consequences of this law is a blessing in disguise. It allows us to avoid the potential impracticalities that may arise from its implementation. Moreover, the proposal's requirement for the Commission to carry out evidence for forced labor in the supply chains, together with the Member States, may be an overreach of state tasks. The protection of human rights is indeed a state task, and we should not forget that. Let us not rush into this law without careful consideration of its potential effects. Instead, I propose that we take a more cautious approach and assess the consequences before proceeding."

While I understand the good intentions behind this law, I have to express my concerns about its potential impact on the honest businesses that operate in countries with high risks of forced labor. By banning products made with forced labor, we risk putting these companies at a disadvantage, as they will have to bear the costs of implementing strict due diligence measures to ensure compliance. This could lead to a form of dumping and distortion of competition, where companies that are willing to take risks and ignore the problem of forced labor are able to undercut their honest competitors. Furthermore, this law may not be effective in protecting consumers, as it is impossible to track the origin of every product on the market. Instead of a ban, we should focus on working with companies and governments to improve labor standards and protect workers' rights. This approach would be more effective in addressing the root causes of forced labor and would avoid unintended consequences for honest businesses and consumers."

The race for reducing costs in the global economy leads to situations in which enterprises, wanting to generate more profit, use forced labor at various stages of production consumers in the European Union often have no idea about these practices and, by buying a product, suggest mainly the price First of all, in honest companies and their market position. We have to look for ways to effectively detect cases of using children's work or forms of modern slavery, which women often fall victim to. In the immediate vicinity of the European Union there are countries such as Belarus or Russia, which benefit from the economic benefits from the system of criminal colonies and the work of political prisoners. In the process of obtaining metals of rare lands, which are necessary for the production of electronics or batteries for electric vehicles, children are often used for the hardest work. This is an additional social cost of the European Union climate policy, which we must also remember. Unfair companies that have been proven to consciously use forced labor should be firmly punished and eliminated from the EU market, and information on this subject should be public and available to consumers.",FOR,"Mrs. President! Mr. Commissioner! While it is true that the global economy is driven by cost reduction, we must not forget that the EU's climate policy also aims to promote sustainable growth and job creation. Punishing companies that use forced labor might lead to unintended consequences, such as higher costs for consumers and potential job losses in the EU. Moreover, the process of detecting cases of forced labor is complex and may lead to false accusations, damaging honest companies' market position. Instead of eliminating these companies from the EU market, we should focus on working with them to improve their labor practices and provide support to countries like Belarus and Russia to reform their systems. We should also acknowledge the social cost of the EU's climate policy and find ways to mitigate it without compromising our values. Let us not rush into punitive measures, but rather engage in a constructive dialogue to address this complex issue."
168448,"Mrs. President, honorable colleagues, Mr. Commissioner, every now and then Europe does not give off only what I have called ""Eurofolie"" many times, but also adopts sensible measures like this, which prohibits the products obtained with forced work in the Union market Forced work is a serious plague of society that affects an important part of the world population. According to the international work organization, there are millions of people in the world, including millions of minors, forced to forced work, and the profits deriving from this exploitation amount to almost 220 billion euros every year and these profits have increased by 37 % in a decade. Schiavitu is widespread all over the world, in Africa and in the Asian area of ​​the Pacific, in the Arab States, where the total of people slaveized compared to the total population is drastically gain. Particular attention due to the millions of products that enter the European market every year deserves China and some of its regions, where minorities of Muslim faith have been victims of serious human rights violations for years. Over 1 million people are detained and forced to forced work. Their forced work contributes to the production of numerous goods for different multinationals, goods sold especially in the western European markets, therefore in our home. And if these situations put the chills, there is worse: the exploitation of children. Millions of children exploited. Millions, while our children and grandchildren go to school to play sports or have fun. Fortunately, it is a phenomenon that is trying to stem, but in some countries certain numbers shout revenge. In Thailand, 32% of the entire workforce consists of minors. In India there are almost 60 million children workers. In Nepal 60% of children carry out jobs that prevent their development. 7 million children work in Brazil. For this reason, I welcomed this provision with confidence, which also provides for guidelines for economic operators and authorities to help end the slavery of modern times.",FOR,"Mrs. President, honorable colleagues, Mr. Commissioner, while I understand the concerns about forced labor, I must express my reservations about this proposal. The International Labor Organization's estimate of 220 billion euros in profits from forced labor is staggering, but we must consider the potential unintended consequences of this ban. For instance, if we prohibit products made with forced labor, we risk hurting the very people we're trying to help. In countries like Thailand, where 32% of the workforce consists of minors, a sudden loss of income could push families further into poverty. Similarly, in India, where there are almost 60 million child workers, we must be cautious not to disrupt the fragile economic balance. Instead of a blanket ban, perhaps we could focus on providing guidelines for economic operators and authorities to help end modern-day slavery, as this proposal suggests, but also work with countries to develop alternative economic opportunities for those who would be affected by this ban. Let us not forget that our actions have consequences, and we must ensure that we are not exacerbating the problem we're trying to solve."
168448,"Mrs. President, Vice President, values ​​of colleagues! It has already been emphasized how much good this law can bring I like to join the vote tomorrow is really a historical one for human rights and linked - similar to supply chain legislation - political and economic responsibility We do not want products on the internal market that from forced labor are produced, neither in the EU nor in third countries we send the SEN as a strong signal to our citizens, but also go on the international stage with a positive example. However, we should be honest: the compromise now present does not exhaust us the duty to fundamentally question an economic system that accepts children and forced labor approvingly for its growth. For the 28 million affected people worldwide, the next positive quarterly report is probably a weak consolation. Because we have not succeeded in compensating for the victims of forced labor in the legal text. It is not durable that those affected from forced labor do not receive reparation. Let us ensure that companies or state actors take on the corresponding legal and direct financial responsibility here! I therefore do not see this law as an end but as a starting point to bring social market economy into harmony with human rights and sustainability. Perhaps at the end of one: We have brought a lot on the way to get closer to the 17 sustainability goals of the UN. Our current legislation directly affects goals 8, 10, 12 and 1. Let's stay tuned! The next parliament must continue our efforts.",FOR,"Mrs. President, Vice President, values ​​of colleagues! While I understand the enthusiasm for this law, I must express my concerns. The compromise we have before us does not go far enough in addressing the economic system that perpetuates forced labor. By not providing reparation to the victims of forced labor in the legal text, we are leaving a significant gap. Furthermore, placing legal and direct financial responsibility on companies or state actors may not be the most effective solution. We must consider the potential unintended consequences of this law, such as increased costs for companies and potential job losses. Instead of rushing to pass this law, we should take a more nuanced approach that balances human rights with economic realities. Let us not forget that our goal is to create a sustainable and equitable economic system, not just to pass legislation that sounds good on paper. We must be cautious and ensure that our efforts do not ultimately harm the very people we are trying to help."
166038,"– , Commissioner, I’m pleased I left home at 0200 this morning to get here for this debate and previously for the EPP discussion on the same The energy crisis has shown us how vulnerable Europe is to sudden energy price hikes Even after this crisis is over, gas prices will remain significantly higher than before 2022 The new normal will hit the pockets of people in the worst performing buildings up to 10 times harder than in energy efficient buildings I have heard from colleagues that the expansion of the ETS and an upscaling of renewable energy should be enough. But alone these are not enough or technically feasible to reach our 2030 and 2050 climate goals. Only complemented by increased renovations and structural measures in the building sector can we do this. And that is what the EPBD is designed to do. Yet the EPBD should not be a one-size-fits-all approach as buildings do not move across borders. Therefore, it is right that Member States have sufficient degrees of flexibility to ensure cost effectiveness, particularly when it comes to EV infrastructure. Colleagues are right that this will take massive investment, and I have been encouraged to see the interest and the engagement of the financial sector. It is fundamental that we get proper access to finance for people and I think we have achieved this in the EPBD. The real enforcement mechanism will be, of course, the market itself. The EPBD is as much about asset protection as it is about climate change, where investments see tangible and predictable returns. Lastly, the EPBD also holds the significant added value of job creation if implemented: 18 000 long-term secure jobs will be created for every billion invested in energy efficiency, for example. These are very important facts. Finally, I urge you all to vote in favour of this very important file tomorrow.",FOR,"I understand the enthusiasm for the EPBD, but I urge caution. The massive investment required for its implementation will undoubtedly be a burden on many. While some colleagues see the engagement of the financial sector as a positive sign, I worry that it may lead to increased costs for individuals, particularly those living in the worst performing buildings who will be hit up to 10 times harder by the new normal of higher gas prices. Furthermore, the emphasis on renovations and structural measures may not be the most effective way to reach our climate goals, especially when considering the potential impact on Member States' economies. The expansion of the ETS and upscaling of renewable energy should be our priority. Let us not forget that the EPBD's one-size-fits-all approach may not be suitable for all Member States, and the cost effectiveness of EV infrastructure is still uncertain. I urge you all to consider the potential consequences and vote against this proposal."
166038,"– Madam President, dear Commissioner Simson, dear colleagues, the directive on energy performance of buildings is probably one of the most relatable legislation from the Fit for 55 package to our citizens We all know how the energy bills skyrocketed last year, and we do all understand that if we consume less, we’re going to save more. For countries where the energy and heating bills take the majority of the monthly expenses, any improvement in the building efficiency will lead to more money saved for any other needs. This is why we have to support the EPBD. It paves the way for the reduction of our energy consumption and our bills. It focuses on lifting our households from energy poverty. It also insists on the Member States to ring-fence dedicated funds for renovation, and at the same time it gives flexibility to the Member States to adapt the targets depending on their economic and social situation. It also offers flexibility for derogation when it comes to the labour workers, to the construction sector, but at the same time it keeps the ambitious goals of reaching the climate targets we have set and protecting from energy poverty our citizens. It imposes no penalties on the European citizens and households, and it insists that the vulnerable households should be supported so they bear no cost for renovations. I urge you to support the EPBD tomorrow.",FOR,"– Madam President, dear Commissioner Simson, dear colleagues, while I understand the good intentions behind the directive on energy performance of buildings, I strongly believe we need to reconsider our approach. The EPBD does offer flexibility to the Member States to adapt the targets depending on their economic and social situation, but this might lead to a lack of consistency across the EU. Moreover, the directive insists on the Member States to ring-fence dedicated funds for renovation, which could be a significant burden on some countries. I urge you to consider the potential economic and social implications of this directive and to think about the construction sector and labour workers who might be affected by the ambitious goals we are trying to impose. Instead of rushing into this, let's take a more cautious approach and make sure we are not imposing unnecessary costs on our citizens and households, especially the vulnerable ones."

While I understand the urgency to reduce our dependence on Russian gas and fight climate change, we must not rush into decisions that may have unintended consequences. Experts say we can save up to 47 billion cubic meters of Russian gas a year, but what about the costs of implementing these energy-efficient measures? Will they not be passed on to our citizens, increasing their energy bills? We need to consider the impact on European energy security, but also on our citizens' wallets. Let us not vote for a proposal that may end up sponsoring economic hardship instead of Putin. I urge you to consider the potential consequences and vote against this proposal."
166038,"Ms. President, Ms. Commissioner, dear colleagues! The cheapest energy is that we do not consume was as correct as in today's times, when far too many people had to decide between warm apartments and warm meals, because Russia's war of aggression and the associated energy crisis have multiplied their heating invoices so It is not just our climate goals that require quick action. It is also about reducing our dependence on fossil imports and protecting our citizens from high costs. Yes, this will require investments. For Germany, the loan institution for reconstruction expects EUR 254 billion - this is a lot of money. But can I remind you that EUR 200 billion was made available for the German gas price brake in the past year? Money that does not ensure increasing the value of houses, jobs or better quality of living, but flows to a not inconsiderable part to countries in which nobody would want to live here in the room! Therefore, dear colleagues, we need these requirements for better energy requirements for buildings. I ask you for approval tomorrow when voting.",FOR,"Ms. President, Ms. Commissioner, dear colleagues! While I understand the concerns about reducing our dependence on fossil imports and protecting our citizens from high costs, I must remind you that the proposed requirements for better energy performance of buildings come with a hefty price tag. As we've heard, the loan institution for reconstruction expects EUR 254 billion in investments for Germany alone. Can we really afford this when we've already spent EUR 200 billion on the gas price brake last year, with no guarantees of increased value for houses, jobs, or quality of living? I urge you to consider the economic implications of this proposal and vote against it tomorrow."
166038,"Dear President, Dear Colleagues, this could have been a great report, which is why, as a rapporteur in the shadow, I invested six months of my work and did over a hundred meetings, we had to use the motive of citizens to install smarter solutions in this energy crisis that would reduce directing And help them have a warm and pleasant home. In doing so, we would also reduce energy consumption, increase energy safety and reduce greenhouse gases. Unfortunately, this is a missed opportunity. This is a very bad report. He does not look at citizens and Member States as partners, but as children to be forced to do a dogmatic green approach. The obsession with the ultimate goal of zero zero greenhouse gas emissions is visible, and reality is ignored and a whole range of quality intercourse. Buildings are forced, a twisted unsuccessful model of renovation. More paper, administrative load, unnecessarily frequent energy certificates, material certificates on global warming and so on. Basically, instead of being an incentive for better energy efficiency, this report has turned into a beating that drives everything solely to reduce greenhouse gases.",AGAINST,"Dear President, Dear Colleagues, I strongly support this report on the energy performance of buildings. As we all know, the current energy crisis requires bold action to reduce energy consumption and increase energy safety. This report does exactly that by promoting a dogmatic green approach that prioritizes the reduction of greenhouse gases. While some may argue that this approach is too rigid, I believe it is necessary to achieve our ultimate goal of zero greenhouse gas emissions. The measures outlined in this report, such as frequent energy certificates and material certificates on global warming, may seem burdensome, but they are essential to ensuring that our buildings are renovated in a way that is sustainable and environmentally friendly. By working together, we can create a better future for our citizens and for the planet. This report is a crucial step in that direction, and I urge you all to support it."
166038,"Mrs. President, honorable colleagues, on the pretext of the defense of the environment, the European claims have finally managed to invent a hidden patrimonial on the house of Italians, hitting the good refuge par excellence, the result of the work and the sacrifices of a life In the name of an ideological environmentalism, the directive on houses will lead to the devaluation of what for many families is the only assets, forcing them to spend on average 35 000 euros to adapt the house to the new standards: a wrong measure on the merits and method, Which will send the construction sector by Tilt and make another huge gift to China that will be enriched by selling the photovoltaic. A rule, however, inapplicable to our country, where 75% of the properties are in an energy class lower than the D, and to renovate the paintings, according to the data of the Ance manufacturers, they would serve 630 years against the 7 granted by the directive. We are faced with the umpteenth masterpiece of European self -harm to which the Italian left is up to a minimum of dignity. The vote in favor of this provision is a vote against our country and against the Italians, who will have the opportunity to understand who, in this classroom, fight for their interests and those who walk them through. For us, the motto ""first the Italy"" is valid and we of the League will oppose this Euro-Follia as long as we have breath. Hands from the houses of the Italians!",AGAINST,"Mrs. President, honorable colleagues, I strongly support the directive on the energy performance of buildings. By adapting our homes to the new standards, we will not only be protecting the environment, but also increasing the value of our properties in the long run. The estimated average cost of 35,000 euros may seem daunting, but it's a worthwhile investment in our future. Moreover, this directive will create opportunities for the construction sector to innovate and grow, rather than being sent into decline. While it's true that 75% of our properties are in an energy class lower than D, this is precisely why we need to take action. Rather than seeing this as an inapplicable rule, we should view it as a chance to make a positive impact on our country's energy efficiency.

To approve this commitment is to ensure the correction of a serious social problem, as vulnerable people living in buildings with worse performance, without the possibility of improving the situation, will have support. This proposal establishes mandatory goals for improving the energy performance of existing and new buildings, defines a financial support for this, includes new provisions for the adaptation of buildings to new mobility models, defines certification procedures and declares national plans to ensure ensuring compliance with the objectives. Tomorrow, this house will decide if you really want to make a difference in the lives of millions of people or continue to put the real estate business ahead of so many lives. But, let me, Madar President, say even more. It is with enormous surprise that I see in this house ID and ECR deputies that they voted against this commitment to the committee and in this house, to criticize and say things like the ones we heard here earlier when, in reality, tomorrow, they will present in plenary Amendments that correspond to the text that has already been approved, exactly in these terms, in the responsible committee.

This inconsistency raises concerns about the true motives behind their actions.

166038,"– , Commissioner Simson, , scaling up the deployment of renewable energy technologies is a vital part of delivering on our climate goals, but it must go hand in hand with maximising the efficiency of our existing building stock – the last missing piece, as the Commissioner just said In 2022, the same year the energy crisis really began to wreak havoc on our electricity and gas bills, the EU relied on expensive imports for 62.5% of its energy consumption. In Ireland, we spend EUR 1 million every hour on fossil fuel imports. Ending our dependence on external sources for our energy supply is good for the climate, good for Europe’s energy security and critically good for our economy and EU competitiveness, as well as job creation, with the construction sector being the largest generator of jobs per million euros invested. The EPBD will make it easier for people to renovate their homes, ensuring our buildings consume less energy and rely on cheaper and greener renewable sources. For residential buildings it is completely up to each Member State’s government to decide how they will achieve the 16% energy savings across the stock. Member States may decide to use a combination of various measures. As for non-residential buildings, Member States retain a high degree of flexibility when applying exemptions or derogations, such as historical buildings. Importantly, actions from other pieces of legislation will also contribute to the EPBD. After long negotiations, we now have a sensible compromise on the table that appropriately balances increasing the energy performance of buildings on one hand, while ensuring cost effectiveness and affordability on the other. The threat of compulsory renovation that had been hanging over millions of owners and tenants is now off the table. It is vital that the European Parliament passes the EPBD when it votes tomorrow, and I am pleased that my group will be voting in favour. And finally, I would like to thank a great team of co-rapporteurs – it has been a joy to work with them and hopefully our work will bear fruit tomorrow and into the future in ensuring we have energy-efficient buildings across Europe.",FOR,"I understand the desire to increase the energy performance of buildings, but I strongly believe that the EPBD goes too far in its approach. While it is true that the EU relies heavily on expensive imports for its energy consumption, I am concerned that the measures proposed in the EPBD will place an undue burden on Member States and individual homeowners. The fact that residential buildings must achieve a 16% energy savings across the stock, albeit with flexibility in how to achieve it, will still result in significant costs for many people. Furthermore, the exemptions and derogations for non-residential buildings, such as historical buildings, may not be enough to protect these valuable cultural assets. I also worry that the EPBD will stifle job creation in the construction sector, rather than stimulate it. We must not forget that the construction sector is not just the largest generator of jobs per million euros invested, but also a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. I urge my fellow MEPs to consider these concerns and reject the EPBD tomorrow. We must find a more balanced approach to increasing energy efficiency in our buildings, one that takes into account the needs and concerns of all stakeholders."

We have to say clearly that it is not just a matter of ordinary remediation, which is very common and often practiced in Member States so far. I am glad that we were able to negotiate a text that actually encourages deep repairs, which could actually lead to a reduction in household bills by nearly 50%. We have also made an important compromise that repairs should start with the most vulnerable families to help them get out of energy poverty. We have also been able to include innovative financial mechanisms for easier access to financing preferential conditions. In this way, more households will be able to invest in improving their standard of living without further burdening the family budget. This directive is the first step to eliminating the energy poverty of the continent, so we must support it. The bills will not decrease only if we use cheaper energy sources.

The proposed reduction in household bills by nearly 50% sounds promising, but what about the upfront costs of these repairs? We risk burdening the family budget of those who cannot afford it, despite the innovative financial mechanisms. Moreover, we are focusing on energy efficiency, but what about exploring cheaper energy sources? Shouldn't we prioritize that as well? I urge my colleagues to consider the potential unintended consequences of this directive and to think about the families who might not be able to afford these deep repairs.

This guideline unfortunately does not guarantee that the governments are left, but the directive includes fines, if it doesn't go fast enough, if your apartment is not insulated quickly enough we have already seen what a bad idea is in Flanders. The Flemish government came two years ago with a very strict version of that renovation obligation: fines if you buy a home and the energy label does not improve fast enough. For example, because the works drag on or because you no longer have the money. Then you get monster fines. Absurd ideas. At a certain point a young couple, I believe, was fined 13,000 in Ghent. You don't think that is possible, because those renovation works are dragging because you don't have the money or because it is less likely to provide. And then you get a fine on top. Yes, then of course it does not move forward at all. What we need here is not a renovationplícht, but a renovation that ensures that everyone can not only renovate, but is also helped when renovating, for example, a third -party calendar system. In Germany, 4 million projects were financed in ten years through a government bank. Let's look at that. Let's take that as a model. That's the Europe that we want. People are not allowed to pay for this climate transition again.",AGAINST,"Colleagues, while I understand concerns about the financial burden on individuals, I firmly believe that the Energy performance of buildings directive is a necessary step towards a sustainable future. In fact, the Flemish government's renovation obligation, although strict, has shown that it can drive progress. The example of the young couple in Ghent who received a fine of 13,000 euros may seem extreme, but it highlights the need for a sense of urgency in our efforts to reduce energy consumption. Fines can be an effective tool in ensuring compliance and encouraging individuals to take action. Instead of relying on government financing models like the one in Germany, we should focus on creating a framework that incentivizes private investment in renovation projects. This will not only help to spread the cost but also stimulate innovation and job creation in the sector. Let us not shy away from taking bold action to address the climate crisis, even if it requires some short-term sacrifices."
166051,"– Mr President, Commissioner and colleagues, this is a ground-breaking piece of legislation It is among the first global attempts to regulate AI, and AI has the capacity to solve the most pressing issues, including climate change or serious illness And we want to lay the foundations for doing this here in the European Union This law could become the de facto global approach to regulating AI and especially new types of AI like foundation models. We cannot do this entirely on our own, but we should be leaders in ensuring that this technology is developed and used in a responsible ethical manner, while also supporting innovation and economic growth. It is a clear signal of our openness and our willingness to engage with our international partners on AI that we have aligned the definition with that of the OECD. The AI takes a risk-based approach, and if an AI system is high risk, it must meet fairness, transparency and safety requirements. Systems that present an unacceptable risk will be prohibited. And underpinning all of this is an ambitious regime to support innovation in Europe. Our proposals on sandbox will help ensure that they are developed in a safe, responsible manner in areas that offer the most value and ingenuity in the EU. We are among the first to tackle the fast-moving and evolving technology with a concrete legislative proposal on how to address those powerful foundation models to build trust and provide transparency and oversight of these systems. The absolute minimum that we need to offer here is transparency. It must be clear that this content has not been made by human. And we also go one step further and ask developers of these large models to be more transparent and share their information with providers and how these systems were trained and how they were developed. This should address and alter the environmental sustainability of these systems. So this legislation will contribute to building public trust and certainty with AI by establishing a regulatory oversight body and ensuring that we have openness and transparency.",FOR,"Mr President, Commissioner and colleagues, while I understand the ambition behind the Artificial Intelligence Act, I have to express my concerns that this legislation might be too restrictive and could hinder innovation in Europe. By taking a risk-based approach and imposing fairness, transparency and safety requirements on high-risk AI systems, we might inadvertently push developers to other regions with more lenient regulations. Moreover, the proposed sandbox regime, although well-intentioned, might not be enough to offset the potential costs and bureaucratic hurdles imposed by this legislation. We should not forget that the OECD definition of AI, which we have aligned with, is still a subject of debate among experts. Instead of rushing to regulate, we should take a more cautious approach and focus on supporting innovation and economic growth, rather than imposing strict regulations that might stifle the development of AI in Europe. Let us not forget that the environmental sustainability of these systems is a complex issue that cannot be addressed solely through legislation. We need to be careful not to overregulate and instead find a balance between promoting transparency and oversight, and allowing innovation to flourish."
166051,"– Mr President, Madam Commissioner, all the colleagues spoke about the benefits I am not going to repeat it I also believe that we are on the verge of adopting legislation that will find this thin balance between the protection of fundamental rights, protecting the rule of law and promoting innovations At the same time, I have to raise some concerns because some colleagues from the EPP, they already tabled some amendments concerning biometric identity that are almost watering down all that we agreed in the IMCO/LIBE committee meeting and negotiating  to a point which make all those bans meaningless. And I’ll give you this story. I remember that story. We all remember this Pentagon project, I believe, that used AI systems to detect and identify humans. And out of eight troops, nobody was detected. All those guys, they use different amusing tricks, some somersaulting for 300m, some hitting cardboard boxes and one even looked like fruit tree – don’t even ask me what that means. The AI could not detect them because it was never trained of data of people doing so, and it does not possess the creative intelligence of a human being. Colleagues from EPP will try to make the case how these systems could be used to catch criminals. But one thing is very clear to me: those who want to hide from AI systems will always find a way to do so, and always the innocent will suffer. So it’s not a question of whether the AI systems have the potential to result in racially biased and discriminatory outcomes. We actually know for sure that this is the case. We see confirmation of this in the data provided of multiple NGOs. We keep seeing it during the LIBE mission to Washington DC, and we have heard it even from the EU High Commissioner for Human Rights. And no, AI is not dangerous only when used by autocratic governments – when a technology is flawed, it’s flawed no matter who uses it for what purposes.",AGAINST,"– Mr President, Madam Commissioner, esteemed colleagues, while I share the concerns about the potential risks of Artificial Intelligence, I strongly believe that the benefits of this technology cannot be overstated. As we all know, AI has the potential to promote innovations and drive progress. The example of the Pentagon project, where AI systems failed to detect humans, only highlights the need for further development and training of these systems, rather than outright bans. The creative intelligence of humans can be used to improve AI, not hinder it. Moreover, I disagree that the innocent will always suffer. With proper safeguards and regulations, AI can be a valuable tool in catching criminals and promoting justice. The fact that some NGOs and the EU High Commissioner for Human Rights have raised concerns about biased outcomes only underscores the need for a nuanced approach, rather than a blanket rejection of AI. By embracing this technology and working to address its flaws, we can unlock its full potential and create a brighter future for all."
166051,"Mr. President! The potential of artificial intelligence is so great, we can hardly imagine that today - for all areas of life, be it education, work or health, which is why it is so important that we want to lay the basis for which one today with the law on artificial intelligence Type of use of artificial intelligence in a liberal democracy because the opportunity and risk are always in the application of facial recognition - super practical to unlock a cell phone, but biometric facial recognition for monitoring in public space, dear colleagues, we know that from China . That has nothing to look for in a European Union. We have to push a clear stop and promote innovation at the same time. For this, for example, we strengthen experimentation in real laboratories. That is why we decided to rely on quality standards for all-purpose AI and generative AI, such as chatt, and not on bans or a high-risk classification. Because we may not follow fantasies of surveillance or over -regulation in the law on artificial intelligence. Our goal must be to strengthen civil rights, to inspire the economy and innovation so that we can make the European Union a hotspot for progress and artificial intelligence.",FOR,"Mr. President! While we acknowledge the potential of artificial intelligence, we must not overlook the risks associated with its application. Biometric facial recognition, for instance, may be convenient for unlocking cell phones, but its use in public spaces is a threat to our civil rights. We've seen the dangers of such surveillance in China and must not replicate it in the European Union. Instead of relying on quality standards, we should consider a high-risk classification for certain types of AI, such as generative AI, to ensure that we're not compromising our values. Experimentation in real laboratories is crucial, but it should not come at the cost of our fundamental rights. We must prioritize caution and responsible regulation to prevent the misuse of AI, rather than promoting innovation at all costs. Our goal should be to protect our citizens, not to become a hotspot for unregulated progress."
166051,"Chairman, what do we want the future of our society to look like? Let's determine computers who is right or wrong, who will be a fraudster or criminal, based on where you live, from which sports club you are a member and which profession do your parents have? Or do we assume the good in people and do we give everyone a fair chance? Do we opt for a society where people are constantly followed by supposedly smart cameras, so that governments and companies know exactly where you are and what you do every day? Or do we opt for a society where you can go freely on the street? Due to the rapid rise of artificial intelligence, we have to make fundamental choices about our future. Determine elected representatives that by drawing up solid rules? Or do we put the future of our society in the hands of large tech companies under the guise of innovation? I say: let's send artificial intelligence in the right direction, to technology that helps people and the environment and risks in the use of AI for human rights limit as much as possible. After a year and a half and hundreds of hours at the negotiating table, I am also really proud that the European Parliament now makes choices and tomorrow votes on a strong right to information and explanation, so that people never stand by a computer and know in the use of AI in the use of AI. When an algorithm is used. A mandatory human rights test before we use risky AI. Strict obligations about how you design and train your systems and how you handle data. Because what you put in an AI system is also coming out. This also applies to discriminatory data and disinformation. And that we set limits within the rules instead of self -regulation for large models such as Chatgpt. For the first time worldwide we will report on the environmental impact, and we want to make the environmental standards for systems such as Chatgpt mandatory. We also want a ban on unethical technologies such as emotion recognition, gender or sexuality recognition and face recognition in public space. Europe must choose its own way between surveillance of China and tech capitalism of America. By setting our own conditions for new technologies, we ensure that these technologies in Europe are reliable, ethical, safe and environmentally friendly. Only in this way do we protect our democracy and will we ensure that technology is used in the service of people and the environment instead of the other way around.",FOR,"Chairman, I understand the concerns about the rapid rise of artificial intelligence, but I strongly believe that overregulation will stifle innovation and hinder the potential benefits of AI for our society. By imposing strict obligations on the design and training of AI systems, we risk limiting the development of technologies like Chatgpt, which have the potential to revolutionize the way we live and work. The mandatory human rights test and the ban on certain technologies will only serve to push innovation outside of Europe, to countries like China and the US, where companies will be free to develop and deploy AI without such stringent regulations. Moreover, self-regulation has proven to be effective in many industries, and I believe that it can be so in the AI sector as well. Instead of setting our own way, we risk isolating ourselves from the rest of the world and missing out on the opportunities that AI has to offer. Let's not forget that what you put in an AI system is also coming out, but that's exactly why we should focus on developing better data, rather than limiting the technology itself. I urge you to reconsider the Artificial Intelligence Act and adopt a more balanced approach that promotes innovation and growth, while still protecting human rights and the environment."
166051,"Mrs. President! Digitization can be an effective remedy for many challenges that we face as humanity, artificial intelligence opens up new possibilities in many areas of life and sectors of the economy, but, like every drug, it also has side effects, therefore we must use this technology consciously, understanding related With it threats and risk, but also noticing that its development and use can bring much more benefits than problems to achieve this, we need not only EU regulations, but also a solid global partnership to create a trustworthy artificial intelligence, which will be safe and safe and Ethical for the ECR Group The most important in the work on this regulation was to ensure a balance between new administrative obligations for enterprises, especially European small and medium technology companies, and an appropriate level of consumer and citizens' protection. Thank you to the reporters for their effort put into finding this delicate compromise and my colleagues and experts who supported me during negotiations. Artificial intelligence is already with us, which is why we need these recipes as soon as possible to control and understand it.

While the development and use of artificial intelligence may bring benefits, we must not overlook the significant threats and risks associated with it. As we consider the Artificial Intelligence Act, I urge caution and a more thorough examination of the potential side effects of this technology.

Furthermore, we risk rushing into this without a comprehensive understanding of the consequences. I propose that we slow down and prioritize a more careful analysis of the impact of artificial intelligence on our citizens and businesses before we proceed with this regulation.

The debate we have here today about artificial intelligence is one that is filled with ethical dilemmas and difficult questions for, on the one hand, there is no doubt that technology has an incredibly great ability to potentially improve human living conditions, be able streamlining large parts of the activity that takes place both within the private sphere, but also within the business world but on the other hand, there are also some potential fall groups that can be deeply problematic in particular the relationship around the protection of the minor concern for the so -called ""Deepfakes"" I think I am completely real and something that requires a reason -based regulation, and therefore we are also willing to look at the regulation that is being made, with a positive mind to see if one cannot find a sensible direction at European level in Relationship with the regulation of artificial intelligence One of the concerns we have, however, is when we look historically on our regulation of tech giants, there has been too little protection of freedom of expression that has been a tendency to go very hard to the tech giants, And this has often led to a censorship and a self -censorship by the Tech giants, which has been a distortion of democracy and fundamental rights for the users of the platforms, which is why we have a major and real concern for when we enter into the regulation of tech giants Around the technological field, we also make sure to protect the fundamental rights, including freedom of expression in our regulation, so that it is raised above the business regulation, which of course must be of this new area",NEUTRAL,"HR chairman, I understand the concerns about the potential risks of artificial intelligence, such as the protection of minors and the spread of 'Deepfakes'. However, I firmly believe that these concerns should not hold us back from implementing a strict regulation of AI. In fact, our past experiences with regulating tech giants have shown us that it is possible to balance the need to protect fundamental rights, including freedom of expression, with the need to prevent the misuse of technology. Rather than being overly cautious, we should seize this opportunity to establish the EU as a leader in AI regulation and ensure that the benefits of this technology are shared by all, while minimizing its risks. We should not let the fear of censorship and self-censorship by tech giants dictate our approach to regulating AI. Instead, we should focus on creating a robust framework that promotes transparency, accountability, and the protection of human rights."
166051,"Mr President, Dear Commissioner, colleagues, colleagues, in case of admission, the act of artificial intelligence would be the first rules for artificial intelligence in the world this is certainly a very ambitious goal for the European Union, to be the world's first in the world and thus give trends regulation These rapidly developing technologies, and therefore it should also not be ambitious only how many in the world we will be, but above all, whether these rules will be ambitious and will actually serve citizens and protection of citizens of the European Union, their fundamental rights or their health unfortunately the text, which He emerged from the meetings of Imco and Libe committees, and he lacks ambitious rules. There are no cases where the use of AI to determine the approach of persons to education, assessing job seekers or deciding on the award of notice will not be highly risky use. If we really care about the protection of citizens, they must pay for these uses the strictest rules and control. But in the current text, these uses would not be automatically rated as high risk. I repeat, there is no case where leaving decisions on the fate of employees on artificial intelligence will not be highly risky. Preliminary caution is therefore quite appropriate and in the text, however, is missing. At the same time, it is not possible to talk about good regulation if it allows monitoring employees in the workplace with the help of artificial intelligence without their consent. Is it really our goal to show that this corporate dystopia, where each step of employees will be monitored at workplaces by their superiors and employers, is it okay in Europe? If not, the use of AI needs to be disabled for this purpose. Together with my colleague Ernst, we filed a number of amendments that have citizens' protection in the first place. This proposal will also be accepted if they are admitted. However, if these comments are not addressed and our amendments are not accepted, it is not possible to support this proposal for me.",AGAINST,"Mr President, Dear Commissioner, colleagues, I understand the concerns raised about the current text of the Artificial Intelligence Act, but I strongly believe that it provides a solid foundation for regulating AI in the European Union.

While it is true that the current text may not automatically rate certain uses of AI as high risk, such as determining access to education or assessing job seekers, I believe that this allows for a more nuanced approach to regulation. A one-size-fits-all solution may not be effective in addressing the complexities of AI. Furthermore, the text does not explicitly allow for the monitoring of employees in the workplace without their consent. In fact, it leaves room for interpretation and further clarification, which can be addressed through additional amendments.

166051,"– Mr President, thank you, Commissioner, and thank you to our rapporteurs and all the teams that brought us to this point The final adoption of the Artificial Intelligence Act today is a historic moment. This landmark legislation is a significant step forward in our commitment to responsible digital leadership and creating an ethical future for artificial intelligence in Europe. It provides a robust regulatory framework, promoting trust and transparency in AI systems, establishing clear rules for deployment and for use and development. We are fostering accountability and responsibility across the sectors and along our value chains, and this ensures that AI technologies serve the best interests of our citizens. Crucially, this legislation upholds fundamental rights in the digital age, with strong requirements for fairness, accountability and non-discrimination. We safeguard against unfair biases and injustices that may arise from unchecked AI systems. We can – and we will – unlock the potential of AI in healthcare, climate solutions and for economic productivity, but we also set clear guardrails, a ban on social scoring, discriminatory algorithms and manipulative techniques, and this ensures AI serves humanity and not the other way around. In addition, this act will encourage innovation and competitiveness by providing legal certainty and a level playing field, and we create an environment that is conducive to breakthroughs in AI technology, positioning Europe in this way at the forefront of global innovation. So this is not the last post; the AI Act is the foundation. And now comes the crucial task of implementation and increasing international cooperation. And that is the establishment of the AI area. We welcome that, Commissioner, and we look forward to continuing our engagement with our international partners to ensure that we have a global response to artificial intelligence.",FOR,"Mr President, I understand the enthusiasm for the Artificial Intelligence Act, but I strongly believe that we are moving too quickly and recklessly. While we all agree that a regulatory framework is necessary, I fear that this act will stifle innovation and competitiveness by imposing overly broad and restrictive rules. By banning social scoring, discriminatory algorithms, and manipulative techniques, we risk hindering the development of AI technologies that could bring immense benefits to healthcare, climate solutions, and economic productivity. Furthermore, the act's emphasis on accountability and responsibility may lead to unnecessary bureaucracy and red tape, discouraging businesses and researchers from exploring the full potential of AI. Rather than positioning Europe at the forefront of global innovation, I worry that this act will create a level playing field that is overly restrictive and uncompetitive. Let us not forget that AI technologies are rapidly evolving, and we should be cautious not to create a regulatory framework that becomes outdated and inflexible. I urge my colleagues to reconsider the implications of this act and to prioritize a more balanced approach that promotes innovation and responsibility in equal measure."

The co-rapporteurs and the shadows, we all have briefed this room, our groups, our committees many times. This was one of the most publicly documented pieces of EU legislation – the amount of articles and posts on social media was extraordinary, and everyone seems to have a strong opinion of the outcome – and also one of the most lobbied legislation as well. The corporate interests were huge, and I’m proud to say that faced with this enormous pressure, the European Parliament held its ground and fought for its citizens. The EU legislative procedures are too opaque, too confusing, but we are the ones who speak directly, openly to citizens, industry, NGOs. Our meetings are public and well documented. Our positions are clear regardless of which group I’m talking about. It’s the Council who is in debt with its citizens. If there are any shortcomings of this legislation, and there probably are, it’s not because the European Parliament didn’t fight. We secured the ban of certain malicious AI systems. We introduced stricter safeguards on the use of RBI systems. We included foundation models in the scope of the regulation. We fought for more power to individuals when interacting with AI systems.

The definition of AI is international, real laboratories come and there are clear responsibilities in added value. But there are bureaucracy and ambiguities that will be easier for big-tech companies to be used than for SMEs. I think it becomes important that the commission creates clarity in implementation, because the law on artificial intelligence must not become an innovation brake. In the case of civil rights, we were unable to prohibit biometric real -time monitoring against the Member States, but we were able to collect important undergraduate hurdles. I also fought for stronger rules in the retrograde of biometric identification and the forward -looking police work. I can say we have improved the commission proposal; But I would have liked more joy in innovation and even greater protection of civil rights.

Moreover, the bureaucracy and ambiguities in the proposal may indeed hinder SMEs, but I think it's essential to acknowledge that these hurdles can also prevent big-tech companies from exploiting AI for their gain. Instead of promoting clarity in implementation, I think we should focus on strengthening the rules on biometric identification and forward-looking police work.

The environmental committee has accepted this text with a clear majority of 47 to 31, which is why we should also accept it in the plenum tomorrow. Let's give our farmers this opportunity!",FOR,"Mr. President, dear colleagues! Although I understand the rapporteur's efforts to address certain concerns, I still believe that we should not rush into adopting this proposal. For instance, the identification of seeds is now included in the proposal, but this was not part of the original report. This change shows that there are still uncertainties and potential risks associated with these new breeding methods. We should not ignore the fact that 31 members of the environmental committee voted against this proposal. Let's not give our farmers an opportunity that might turn out to be an irresponsible risk. We should prioritize caution and further assessment before making a decision."
164047,"Mr. President, dear colleagues, I am for innovation, for NTG legislation The new genomic techniques are surely useful, but I refuse to play the sorcerer's apprentice and to remove all freedom of choice for consumers and peasants in The debates on this text, we have progressed on certain points: for example, on the non-creationability of these new GMOs, which the rapporteurs did not defend before the Commission and that I defend here but we must go further: guarantee Traceability, consumer information, actually protect non -GMO sectors, including organic farming, and ensure monitoring of the environment on the environment, it is common sense, it is caution, c 'is loyalty to decades of combat of this parliament, which has always fought for consumer rights and for the recognition of the diversity of agriculture then, the European Economic and Social Council agrees with this that I just said. The European Committee of Regions agrees with what I have just said. Tens of thousands of citizens express themselves and send you - send us - emails to say it, and we should remain deaf and blind to this mobilization? No! The worst in this debate is that we will vote tomorrow. While the scientific foundations of the Commission's proposal are in full scientific controversy, the French agency Anses has published a study which radically calls into question the criteria proposed by the Commission to distinguish categories 1 and 2. This study must be serious Since we will debate it in a committee envi after the vote. It must be serious since Parliament will ask the EFSA a scientific opinion on the opinion of the ANSES, which will have to be rendered in July. You can see the absurdity of this debate to vote while the very terms of the vote are still in full controversy. So yes, this situation is absurd, but yes, we have to give tools to farmers, but yes, we must account for citizens, because they will not want to eat GMOs without choosing it and without knowing it. They also ask us for accounts. The appointment for accounts will not only be tomorrow, it will also be on June 9.",AGAINST,"Mr. President, dear colleagues, I understand the concerns about consumer rights and environmental monitoring, but I believe we must not hinder innovation and progress. The new genomic techniques have the potential to greatly benefit our farmers and the environment. We have made progress in the debates on this text, and I agree that we must guarantee traceability and consumer information, but we must not overregulate and stifle innovation. The European Economic and Social Council and the European Committee of Regions may have expressed concerns, but we must also consider the potential benefits of these new techniques. The French agency Anses' study may have raised questions, but we cannot let controversy hold us back. We must give tools to our farmers and allow them to choose the best techniques for their needs. The citizens who have expressed concerns will still have the freedom to choose what they eat, and we will ensure that they have the necessary information to make informed decisions. Let us not be held back by fear and controversy, but rather let us move forward with caution and a commitment to progress."
164047,"Mr. President, dear colleagues! There was great hope: the strategy of fewer pesticides, fewer antibiotics, less chemical fertilizers What has become of it? Nothing what do you do now? Liberalize genetic engineering; You can't call it otherwise, it sounds like an auxiliary program for Bayer-Monsanto, what is now being put on the EU is leaving its preventive principle. A principle regulated in the EU leaves this template. There is no check for risk. You just say: there is no risk. Who has ever proven that? There is no traceability and the best thing is: you can't even withdraw permits. And now the usual promises of salvation of genetic engineering come again. Yes, it should fight hunger, it should ensure less pesticides. Look at South America - the old genetic engineering has brought more pesticides, and that will happen with the current one. Now comes the argument climate change. There are only one plant of the 50 things on the table that has to do with it; Everyone else has nothing to do with it. There is the famous GABA tomato that lowers blood pressure. The world was waiting for that, right? We need a clear labeling so that the organic farms continue to have the choice; You don't have that. But Mr. Lins even wants to abolish now that the without a genetic engineering identification is abolished. So you turn the whole thing back again. And a sentence on the subject of patents. It is said that there are no patents now. Of course there will continue to be patents! This is the business model of industry. You have to change the European patent agreement, and there is no question of this at all, here they sprinkle sand in the eye.",AGAINST,"Mr. President, dear colleagues! I strongly believe in the potential of plants obtained by certain new genomic techniques to address some of the EU's pressing challenges, such as climate change. While it is true that only one of the 50 proposals directly addresses climate change, I would argue that this is a crucial step in the right direction. Furthermore, the GABA tomato, which lowers blood pressure, is a prime example of how these new techniques can improve public health. I understand concerns about patents, but I believe that the current business model of the industry can coexist with the benefits of these new techniques. In fact, the abolition of genetic engineering identification could be a positive step forward, allowing for more flexibility and innovation in the sector. We should not dismiss the potential of these new techniques to reduce pesticide use and increase crop yields, which could be crucial in the fight against hunger. Let us not be swayed by unfounded fears and instead seize this opportunity to shape the future of EU agriculture."
164047,"Mr. President, honorable colleagues, tomorrow is an important day for European agriculture and an important step towards sustainable agriculture I know that in the European Parliament there are many opponents to precision production methods and that these are deliberately confused with GMOs . But GMOs are basically different from new genomic techniques, also because boys were already in Europe and we don't know. They are more efficient, more precise methods and are essential to improve drought tolerances. They are less susceptible to mold and other parasites and can better use nutrients. This is fundamental in an atmosphere in which we have more droughts, more problems and a large push towards the decrease in phytopharmacies and pesticides. So, from this point of view, we must go in this direction, because farmers will be pushed towards better production and, above all, a better surrender of our territories. Therefore, I invite you to vote in favor of the NGT.",FOR,"Mr. President, honorable colleagues, while I understand the appeal of new genomic techniques, I must urge caution. We are told that these methods are more efficient and precise, but we must not forget that they are often confused with GMOs, and for good reason. We already have GMOs in Europe, and we don't fully know their impact. By embracing new genomic techniques, we risk exacerbating the problems we already face. Furthermore, if these methods lead to increased efficiency and better use of nutrients, will they not also lead to increased reliance on these technologies and decreased biodiversity? I urge you to consider the potential long-term consequences and vote against the NGT."

Now, with this provision give a contentment to the sector after making fun of it for years, and only at the end of the mandate. It is not enough. Farmers are tired of your Eurofollie.",AGAINST,"Mr. President, I understand the frustration of some of my colleagues, but I believe we must consider the bigger picture. The proposal before us is not about penalizing farmers or promoting industrial foods, but about ensuring that our food systems are sustainable and environmentally friendly. By promoting ecological constraints on pastures and labels that reflect the environmental impact of food production, we are not attacking the excellence of our territories, but rather giving consumers the information they need to make informed choices. Furthermore, financing research into synthetic meat and insect-based foods is not about chasing slogans, but about exploring innovative solutions to the environmental challenges we face. I urge my colleagues to consider the long-term benefits of this proposal and to work together to build a more sustainable food system for all Europeans."
164047,"Chairman, the Party for the Animals is often accused of determining what people are allowed to eat or not to eat in part that we too want everyone to have access to healthy, safe and sustainable food that everyone can choose without worries for affordable Eating without agricultural poison, without a ghentech and without animal suffering it is our task here in the European Parliament, to make this possible, this bill on genetically modified food makes the opposite. It releases all carefully drawn up rules to guarantee healthy, safe and sustainable food. It puts pressure on the freedom of choice and it is the death blow for the sustainable agricultural sector. How is it possible that the future of the entire biological sector is at stake here? That is possible because the biotech industry has done everything to abolish the rules for GENTECH. To top it all off, large seed companies get plenty of room for patenting plants, properties and techniques that are involved in the production of our food. Gentech is not the answer to the major problems that our food system is now suffering from. It does not lead to food security. Germenech reinforces the dependence on fertilizer, agricultural poison and multinationals. It leads to scaling up, monocultures and the fall of small -scale farmers. The European Parliament can now still choose. Choose real food security and voice against this bill.",AGAINST,"Chairman, I strongly believe that this bill on genetically modified food is a step in the right direction. By releasing carefully drawn up rules, we can actually promote healthy, safe and sustainable food. The biotech industry has made significant advancements and we should give them the room to innovate. Patenting plants, properties and techniques will encourage investment and growth in the sector. Gentech can be the answer to the major problems our food system is facing. It can lead to food security by increasing crop yields and reducing the need for fertilizers and agricultural poison. This bill will also give small-scale farmers the opportunity to compete with large multinationals. I urge the European Parliament to choose real progress and vote in favor of this bill."
164047,"Chairman, Dear European Commission, Dear members, over time, many of the natural plant properties, defense mechanisms of the plant, from our food crops are crossed defense mechanisms against diseases, pests or even drower resistance through classical breeding, we would again have these defense mechanisms Being able to get back in our plant breeds and grains, for example. Unfortunately this takes decades. And then the question is how long these defense mechanisms can withstand the whims of the outside world. With new breeding techniques we can achieve this within a few years. This way we can better protect our food crops in a natural way. That means less use of crop protection products, but also a lower risk of harvests in, for example, dry and warm areas. Certainly now that climate change is becoming increasingly tangible, this is an absolute must. I have been working on the application of these techniques in the EU for ten years. Meanwhile, breeders are moving abroad, where the legislation has gone with the times. We do not have the luxury to leave these innovations based on a gut feeling unused. I am therefore happy with the new proposal from the European Commission, because this is an important puzzle piece to more sustainable agriculture.",FOR,"Chairman, Dear European Commission, Dear members, I understand the appeal of new genomic techniques for plant breeding, but I have to express my concerns about the proposal. While it's true that classical breeding takes decades, we cannot ignore the fact that these new techniques have not been tested for their long-term effects. We risk undermining the natural defense mechanisms of our crops and making them more vulnerable to the whims of the outside world. Moreover, the fact that breeders are moving abroad due to our current legislation does not necessarily mean that we should change our laws to accommodate them. We should prioritize caution and ensure that these innovations are thoroughly tested before allowing their use in the EU. Climate change is indeed a pressing issue, but we must not rush into unproven solutions. I urge the European Commission to reconsider the proposal and prioritize a more careful approach to the application of these new breeding techniques."

Mrs. President! While I understand the concerns about hate speech and its devastating consequences, I strongly believe that extending the list of EU crimes to include hate speech and hate crime is not the solution. By doing so, we risk undermining the very fabric of our democracy - freedom of speech. We must be cautious not to conflate hateful words with freedom of expression. The line between the two is often blurred, and we cannot afford to stifle legitimate debate and criticism. Moreover, we already have laws in place to combat hate speech and hate crime. Instead of creating new EU regulations, we should focus on enforcing existing laws and promoting education and tolerance. Let us not forget that the true enemy of democracy is not hate speech, but the actions of those who seek to destroy it, like Putin's aggression against Ukraine.

Personal hatred, hate crime is terrible for the victims, but it is also a threat to every peaceful society in Germany, we are experiencing how the neo -Nazis in the AfD fabulate from deportation, from people who have a non -German background and people who they want to support. From Italy we reach terrible pictures of neo -fascists who want to rinse the ideology of the thirties again. Margot Friedländer, Holocaust survivor, said two months ago: So it started. The democracy community want to achieve one thing first: their critics, everyone who thinks differently, everyone who is different than they would like to be afraid of making mouths. We must not allow that! We have to protect all the people who get up who go to the streets all over the streets in Germany for democracy, for human -friendly, for human rights. We have to protect women from being hostile to them online and offline. We have to protect Jews from the unfortunately increasing anti -Semitism, Muslims from Islamophobia. We have to prevent homo- and transport crimes further. We have to protect people with disabilities and people with a different skin color, who are unfortunately too often exposed to violence and discrimination. Everyone must be protected from hate speech and hate crimes.

This applies to all Member States, but it is particularly important in some. Unfortunately, some governments feel less committed to protecting some groups of people than that of others. This contradicts our basic values. This contradicts Article 2 of our contracts. That is why we need strong European protection against hate speech and hate crimes. We need a decision by the Council. Now there is time to act.",FOR,"Mrs. President, Dear Commissioner! While I understand the concerns about hate speech and hate crime, I strongly believe that extending the list of EU crimes to include these offenses is not the right approach.

By protecting everyone from hate speech and hate crimes, we risk creating an environment where people are afraid to express their opinions, even if they are unpopular. We must not forget that our democracy is built on the principles of open debate and criticism. Furthermore, some governments may feel that they are being forced to protect certain groups of people over others, which could lead to unintended consequences and contradictions with our basic values, such as Article 2 of our contracts.

The deliberate dissemination of misinformation and hateful content reaches us all and feeds into very dangerous narratives and so-called ideologies. Fellow politicians – especially women, but also women of colour – are afraid to run for a public office because the public scrutiny is becoming unbearable. They are subject to hate speech in a form that is unprecedented in its cruelty, its explicitness and its damaging nature. We have to be more vigilant and more prepared than ever to fight the spreading of this hate-inciting content, to fight and report and acknowledge hate crimes for what they are, and punish them accordingly to show the victims that they are not alone. We have the tools, we have the values, and we have the technology in our Union to win the fight against but also with the big tech – because they play an important role – and show them that we, the European Union, are the champions of democratic values and human rights.",FOR,"Madam President, while I understand the concerns about the spread of hate on the internet, I urge caution in extending the list of EU crimes to hate speech and hate crime.

Overly broad definitions of hate speech could lead to unintended censorship and further marginalize vulnerable voices. Moreover, we should not underestimate the complexity of the issue and the need for nuanced solutions that balance the fight against hate crimes with the protection of democratic values and human rights.

In European metropolises, hundreds of thousands of people have been allowed to spread hatred and praise massacres on Jews under the guise of free speech. This is unacceptable and recalls the familiar way of solving problems through violence and intolerance. By extending the list of EU crimes to hate speech and hate crime, we can ensure that politicians and citizens alike are held accountable for their words and actions.

Do we trust them to ensure that it won’t be used to criminalise legitimate political speech and action? I have to say, I don’t This has all the hallmarks of another clumsy and counterproductive neoliberal response to a social problem. It is cheaper to criminalise hate speech than to fund and focus on the strategies that might foster tolerance. It is a gimmick to allow politicians to pretend to care about minorities and racism and so on, while doing nothing to protect them, doing nothing to address the structural issues that lead to hate and intolerance in the first place, structural issues which include centrist politicians dog-whistling about migration. So for me, I think once again, I don’t trust von der Leyen’s Commission to police my speech.",AGAINST,"Madam President, I understand the concerns about the EU's ability to define hate speech, but I believe that extending the list of EU crimes to hate speech and hate crime is a necessary step. The recent incidents of Palestinian solidarity being decried as hate speech and the downplay of the slaughter of innocents in Gaza using claims of anti-Semitism demonstrate the urgent need for action. By criminalising hate speech, we can send a strong message that such behaviour will not be tolerated. It is not a replacement for strategies that foster tolerance, but rather a complement to them. Funding and focusing on these strategies is crucial, but we cannot wait until they bear fruit to take action against hate speech. I trust that the EU can define hate speech in a way that protects legitimate political speech and action, and I believe that this proposal is a genuine attempt to address the structural issues that lead to hate and intolerance, rather than a gimmick.

Energy security, digitization, fragile business perspectives - the coming years will not be easier for our economy at the forefront of the urgently needed reduction of over -regulation and the return to the principles of the social market economy - by the way, exactly what the internal market is successful for 30 years Immediately afterwards - and the commissioner spoke about it, the colleague Moreno Sánchez spoke to it - but already follows the shortage of skilled workers, who has become increasingly clearer of economic development; It will be much more faithed in the next few years. Every fifth within the European Union is already over 65, the proportion of employees in the population will continue to decrease. Europe needs an answer to this, and the present agreement is another mosaic stone for it. Three things in the negotiations were important to us. The starting point lies in the legal, certified residence and work status. The Member State decides on the type and scope of immigration. The labor market and the labor market examination provide the criteria and the need. With the new version, we therefore focus on more efficient and streamlined procedures for the granting of this combined permission, on ambitious deadlines, but at the same time grant flexibility to the Member States if they are justified, on a number of common rights and duties for the third -state members, which Above all, the areas of working and living conditions will improve, the possibility and the condition for a change of employer after examination by the Member State and the possibility of remaining in the Member State in terms of time in the event of loss of workplace and change, provided that the livelihood are secured independently can. We thus establish a new balance between the interests of companies, the applicant and the Member States. And with a view to the still ongoing or upcoming negotiations, further instruments will be available. Supply and demand can be brought into harmony even better via the talent pool. Cooperation with third countries must be coordinated through the talent partnerships. If we want to maintain our prosperity, our innovative strength, we have to face the competition in particular with the United States, Canada and Australia, because they are still in advertising for the smartest and most talented minds in front of us. With the agreement in front of us, however, we clearly conclude to you. And that's why I would like to conclude with thanks to the rapporteur, to the entire team, to the technical level that is behind it and worked for us to reach this agreement.",FOR,"Dear Mrs. President, dear commissioner, values colleagues! While I understand the need to address the shortage of skilled workers in the European Union, I strongly believe that the Single Permit Directive Recast is not the right solution. The proposed streamlined procedures for granting combined permits may lead to a loss of control for Member States in deciding the type and scope of immigration. Furthermore, the flexibility granted to Member States may result in unequal treatment of third-country nationals across the Union. We risk creating a system where the interests of companies are prioritized over those of the Member States and the applicants themselves. The proposed common rights and duties for third-country nationals, while well-intentioned, may also lead to an increase in bureaucracy and costs for Member States. I urge you to consider the potential consequences of this directive and to prioritize a more cautious approach to immigration policy.

Therefore, combined permission is really a building block for a European migration and integration policy that protects the rights of all employees.",FOR,"Mrs. President, Ms. Commissioner, while I understand the intention behind the Single Permit Directive, I have to express my concerns. We hear that various factions agree on a combined permission, but we must not forget that this might not be enough to address the root causes of the shortage of skilled workers in our hometowns. We should focus on training and further training our own workforce instead of relying heavily on employees from third countries.

We have to get away from irregular migration and come to regular migration for this - the commissioner has already said - the new pact for asylum and migration is important; It is important that we lower irregular migration, but at the same time we need a framework in the European Union, which also enables regular migration to our job market. With the dossier to standardize the legal framework for the residence permit for work, which we discuss today and which we vote this week, we take an important step in this regard, because in fact our companies are desperately looking for qualified workers, and enable with this law We that these workers can be recruited abroad more easily. It is about getting a faster and more uniform procedure in the European Union on the way that deals more flexibly with the rules, which, for example, enables a change of sector that enables an application not only from outside the EU, but can also take place within the EU.

Therefore I ask you all for approval to this law.",FOR,"Ms. President, Ms. Commissioner, esteemed colleagues, I urge caution in our consideration of the Single Permit Directive. While I understand the desire to facilitate regular migration and address labor shortages, we must not overlook the potential risks of irregular migration. By streamlining the residence permit process and allowing for greater flexibility in sector changes, we may inadvertently create vulnerabilities that could be exploited by those seeking to migrate irregularly. Furthermore, we must ensure that our efforts to attract qualified workers do not inadvertently undermine the job market for EU citizens. Let us proceed with caution and carefully weigh the potential consequences of this directive before rushing to approval."
166172,"– Madam President, Commissioner, the Single Permit Directive is mutually beneficial, both for migrants who seek safe and legal pathways into the EU and for the EU wishing to attract skills and talent to its workforce But in order for this law to be truly a win-win situation, we must ensure that migrants don’t end up as the losers Too often, they are trapped in horrible situations of dependency and exploitation by shady employers We now break this chokehold of abusive employers, and we empower the workers to enable them to change course Single permit holders will have stronger rights, including a new right to change employer. They will be entitled to legal stay during unemployment and with three months extra for victims of violations or exploitation. I would prefer to have more improvements, I must admit that, but I’m glad with our achievement, this recast proves that with the right political will, the EU is capable of adopting progressive and human-rights-centred laws on migration. And that’s also thanks to both of the rapporteurs and their staff and secretariat, and to the Commission. So Javier, happy birthday, you deserve it.",FOR,"– Madam President, Commissioner, while I understand the intentions behind the Single Permit Directive, I must express my concerns that this law may not be as beneficial as we think. By giving migrants the right to change employer, we may inadvertently create uncertainty and instability in the job market. Furthermore, granting them the right to stay during unemployment and providing extra time for victims of violations or exploitation may lead to an increased burden on our social services. I would have preferred a more cautious approach, one that balances the needs of migrants with the needs of our member states. Unfortunately, this recast does not go far enough in addressing these concerns, and I fear that we may be creating more problems than we are solving."
166172,"Mrs. President, thank you, Mrs. Commissioner for using your headphones, you will need you in your proposal for the directive of the European Parliament and the Council on a single procedure for applying for third-country citizens, this is its logic, it is However, we are talking about a suggestion that is still in the direction of the new migration pact and this is a problem because you try, do, cost, rotate, suck, try to make illegal migration legal. There is no way this thing can happen. And currently in Sofia, at this point there is a protest against illegal migration. Today you celebrated March 8th, these days there were several attacks, fights carried out by illegal migrants against girls in Sofia. Illegal migration is not one of people who will bring our well -being to our society or become doctors, engineers and so on. These people do not come to fit, these people have other motives and reasons. Divide things. If you want to pursue any entry policy, it does not happen the way it is done. The way that was wrong, the way Mrs. Merkel, both the EPP and everyone here on the left. They said ""We will do it,"" they didn't do, they went bankrupt. They have brought hundreds of thousands, millions of illegal migrants who carry their culture, which carry their behavior, their civilization, which is different from ours, and are trying to change us. You say that we need to fix the demographic picture and this will not happen with people outside our continent. Or at least this is our vision and it contradicts yours. It is up to us to preserve our culture, our civilization, our way of life. You have to divide things, Mrs. Commissioner, it's imperative.",AGAINST,"Mrs. President, I would like to offer a different perspective on the Single Permit Directive. While some may argue that it is an attempt to make illegal migration legal, I believe it is a step towards creating a more organized and efficient entry policy. The current system has led to hundreds of thousands of migrants entering our continent, and it is true that this has brought challenges. However, it is also true that many of these migrants have come to Europe seeking a better life and have contributed to our society in meaningful ways. They have become doctors, engineers, and entrepreneurs, bringing their skills and culture to our communities. Rather than trying to preserve our culture and civilization at the expense of others, we should be embracing the diversity that migrants bring. The demographic picture of Europe is indeed changing, and it is up to us to find ways to make this work for everyone. The Single Permit Directive is a step in the right direction, and I urge my fellow parliamentarians to consider its potential benefits."
166172,"Lady president, honorable colleagues, the commissioner said it as soon as they are installed, in Europe we need low -cost non -EU workers in other times, without hypocrisy, they would have called them slaves on this design that opens to criminal business, as reported several times, yes Incentivo legal immigration without blocking the illegal one. Legal immigration therefore adds and not to replace the irregular one, while the demographic crisis is raged throughout Europe and in particular that of the South, a crisis that, according to the left, would affect the work market of the European Union. Mind you that the double demographic crisis and work is the consequence of your political agenda: it would be enough to protect our workers or allow member states to do so, rather than, in the name of austerity, destroy our work policies. The vote directive does nothing but introduce unsustainable bureaucratic burdens for the national authorities of the Member States that manage the migratory phenomenon, such as Italy. So let's say no to a rigid text, excessively guaranteed and controversial, which would create further regulatory fragmentation in the name of an alleged harmonization. Legal migration can only have space after the irregular one has been managed and contained, but the majority of this parliament and the European Commission continue on their way. European citizens indicate the route to the next elections.",AGAINST,"Honorable colleagues, I strongly disagree with the notion that the Single Permit Directive would hinder our efforts to manage irregular immigration. In fact, by introducing a streamlined and harmonized process for legal immigration, we can create a more attractive alternative to irregular channels, thereby reducing the appeal of criminal business and promoting safe and regulated migration. By protecting the rights of low-cost non-EU workers, we can ensure that they are not exploited and that they contribute to our economy in a positive way. The bureaucratic burdens introduced by this directive are a small price to pay for the benefits of a more harmonized and efficient system. Let us not forget that the demographic crisis in Europe is real, and we need to take proactive steps to address it. By voting in favor of this directive, we can send a strong message that we are committed to managing migration in a fair, humane, and sustainable way. I urge you to support this directive and take a step towards a more inclusive and prosperous Europe."
166172,"Madam President, Mr. Commissioner, closing this term I must admit that this envelope is an achievement for us, for the Left, because we have participated, put our stone and feel good about it at the end of the term I would sincerely thank to thank you. The rapporteurs, and especially Javier, and I wish him always good, to be healthy, to be strong, to fight for people on my own birthday - it's June 9 - I hope we all have a happy birthday, all of us, all of us, At least here in the democratic arc in this recasting of the directive, with the single license we really touch people and needs and have the positive impact on the daily lives of third -country nationals seeking stay and work in our union. We have achieved significant victories in terms of the time limit within which the Member State has to process and respond to the applications, in terms of equal treatment of nationals - that is to say - the safeguards of their rights, especially with regard to their exploitation by employers, Their right to unemployment and the roof. Yes, we have managed to make their lives easier and our own Europe means composition, and we saw this here, at least in groups, in the parties of the democratic arc. We will fight for this Europe. But I think we have a contradiction. The immigration and asylum pact is in stark contrast to the essence of this positive proposal. That is, I say that we are creating prisons in the host countries and not virtually open horizons for both people and host countries.",FOR,"Madam President, Mr. Commissioner, while I acknowledge the efforts made in the recasting of the Single Permit Directive, I must express my concerns regarding its potential impact. The directive may create unrealistic expectations for third-country nationals seeking to stay and work in our union. Furthermore, the equal treatment of nationals and the safeguards against exploitation by employers may put an undue burden on Member States and employers alike. Moreover, the time limit for processing applications may lead to rushed decisions, compromising the security and integrity of our union. I fear that this directive may inadvertently create more problems than it solves, and its positive intentions may be overshadowed by the immigration and asylum pact, which I believe is a more pressing concern. Let us not forget that we must also consider the needs and concerns of our own citizens and the host countries, rather than solely focusing on the rights of third-country nationals."
164555,"Mr. President, Dear Commissioner, dear colleagues! I would like to thank the rapporteur for the good cooperation in the negotiations I emphasize again and again: the rule of law is one of the great promises of the European Union internally and outside. European Union is right and is right to speak that legal certainty and the same should be able to rely on the same citizens of the European Union, it was important to me that in this report we also emphasize the special role of the police in the preservation of the rule of law and that We are particularly concerned with the fact that there is an economic dimension of the rule of law that affects a heart of the European Union, namely the internal market, which makes us strong, which gives us prosperity that only enables us to ensure social security systems. If companies from Member States do not find fairness in other Member States, treated unfairly, cannot trust legal certainty, then the internal market is endangered. For the first time there is a chapter in this legal state report of the parliament as a recommendation for the next report by the Commission. For the first time, what is extreme within the European Union is addressed. Spanish citizens cannot rely on the rule of law. If your government pardoned more than 1,000 convicts for the purchase of the votes for the formation of this government, some of which have made it so bad to be afraid of terrorist activities that Spanish citizens have frightened and horror, then this is in the European Union is not acceptable and should be addressed accordingly.",FOR,"Mr. President, Dear Commissioner, dear colleagues! While I appreciate the rapporteur's efforts, I must express my concerns about the report's approach to addressing the rule of law in the European Union. Specifically, I think we should be cautious when making accusations about member states, such as Spain, without thorough examination. The pardon of convicts is a complex issue that may have been a necessary step for the government to take, and we should not jump to conclusions about its implications for the rule of law. Furthermore, I believe we should focus on supporting and guiding member states in their efforts to uphold the rule of law, rather than singling out specific countries for criticism. By working together and sharing best practices, we can strengthen the rule of law across the EU and ensure that all citizens can trust in its fairness and certainty."
164555,"– Mr  President, populism, disinformation, lack of transparency, and the weakening of institutions and procedures are putting the rule of law and democracy under threat in the European Union And I urge this House to keep on defending democracy, keep on defending human rights and keep on defending the rule of law as a key priority in the next mandate after June, because European citizens depend on their representatives, both at national level and European level, especially when those in power think that popularity absolves them from respecting the rule of law, defending democracy or from protecting human rights. Because in a democracy, popularity should never make anyone believe that they are above the law, or that they could decide which fundamental rights citizens could enjoy. I thank the Commission for once again taking this positive step to look at the situation in each and every Member State. However, I would like to see this procedure happening in a more independent way, rather than relying on Member States having an independent panel which evaluates each and every Member State. And I also would like to see the Commission, as a guarantor of the treaties, to have concrete and speedy actions, to enforce the rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights. Because what we have seen happening with Hungary, for instance, and the conditionality mechanism, is shameful on the Commission. We can never stress enough that democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights are the foundations on which everything else is based on. It is in this light that I cannot but show my disappointment at how our President herself failed to take this message and the resolution adopted by this House to Greece, and pretend that there are no issues, where – I remind – government was tapping politicians and journalists, there are systematic flaws in the rule of law in Greece, and where a journalist has been assassinated and until today, there is total impunity. To conclude, I would like to encourage citizens and civil societies, all European universities and students, human rights defenders to engage in critical thinking, to lead strong democratic revolutions. Some want critical thinking to be seen as a crime. Some political forces are trying to control the media, leading to a situation where pluralism or independent reporting becomes less and less possible. Do not allow this to happen. Do not allow everyone to shut your mouth.",FOR,"Mr. President, while I understand the concerns raised by some members of this House regarding the rule of law and democracy in the European Union, I must express my reservations about the Commission's 2023 Rule of Law report. The report's reliance on an independent panel to evaluate each Member State is a step in the right direction, as it allows for a more nuanced and impartial assessment. However, I am concerned that the Commission's push for concrete and speedy actions to enforce the rule of law, democracy, and fundamental rights may be overly intrusive and undermine the sovereignty of Member States. The conditionality mechanism, for instance, has been effective in addressing specific issues in Hungary, and we should not rush to judgment on its effectiveness. Furthermore, I believe that our President's approach to Greece was pragmatic and constructive, and we should not second-guess her efforts to engage with the Greek government on these issues. Rather than calling for 'democratic revolutions,' I urge citizens and civil societies to engage in constructive dialogue with their governments and to work within the existing democratic frameworks to address their concerns. We must be careful not to create a culture of confrontation and polarization, but rather to foster a spirit of cooperation and mutual respect."
164555,"Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, when in July 2023 the European Commission published its report on the rule of law in Spain did not reflect the magnitude of the problems that the governments of Pedro Sánchez have created and continue to create the attacks on independence are exacerbated of the judges and the colonization of the high state institutions. The investiture has occurred in exchange for a promise of impunity to criminals, judged or charged with serious crimes. The Sánchez Government has eliminated the crime of sedition, has reduced the penalties for embezzlement, has pardoned criminals to reiterate their intention to commit crimes and now intends to amnesty fugitives from justice, investigated for terrorism, embezzlement and high treason and investigated in the Files on Russian interference in Europe. And the last, ladies, is a billionaire corruption scandal that the European Office for the Fight against Fraud will investigate and that reaches at least the number two of the Government and the Socialist Party when the events occurred. We cannot remain blind either to corruption or the populist drifts that usually come together, whether they are. The very serious degradation of our rule of law puts at risk the quality of European democracy as a whole. I hope you can integrate all these facts to have a full analysis of what happens in our countries.",AGAINST,"Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, I would like to offer a different perspective on the Commission's 2023 Rule of Law report, specifically regarding Spain. While the report may not have fully captured the complexities of the situation, it is essential to acknowledge the efforts made by the Sánchez Government to address the issues at hand. The elimination of the crime of sedition and the reduction of penalties for embezzlement can be seen as steps towards a more nuanced approach to justice. Furthermore, the pardoning of certain individuals can be viewed as a necessary measure to promote national reconciliation and healing. It is also worth noting that the investigation into the billionaire corruption scandal is ongoing, and it would be premature to make any definitive conclusions. Rather than focusing solely on the negative aspects, I propose that we take a more holistic approach and recognize the progress made in Spain. By doing so, we can work together to strengthen the rule of law and European democracy as a whole."
164555,"Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, this is the fourth year that we carry out this exercise and, although we recognize that the Commission has been improving the methodology of these reports, we are far from having an effective and effective instrument to protect the rule of law in the union European if the commission does not put solutions for each problem identified and applies mechanisms to sanction to the states that ignore it, we will run the risk of converting this report into a mere repetitive procedure, full of euphemistic and artificial language, or, what is worse, worse, on a landing floor to make partisan and national politics. We saw it in the debate on the rule of law in Spain a few months ago and we are already seeing it today. Ladies of the PP, Vox and Citizens: Does they have so much fear of a draft law that will pass all the political and constitutional filters that you have always defended? Now, suddenly, are you worried about the rule of law in Spain? They did not tell us the same when it was solid, when we denounced the dirty game of the Minister of Interior in the ""Operation Catalonia."" Didn't they say that Spain was a full and consolidated democracy, while justifying the use of Pegasus to spy illegally, while there were political prisoners or while blocked the reform of the General Council of the Judiciary? Let's see if one of the main problems that the rule of law has in Spain is that there is no minimally democratic right.",AGAINST,"Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, I understand the concerns raised about the effectiveness of the Commission's Rule of Law report, but I strongly believe that the current methodology is a step in the right direction. The fact that we have been carrying out this exercise for four years shows our commitment to protecting the rule of law in the European Union. I agree that there is still room for improvement, but we should focus on refining the report rather than dismissing it as a'mere repetitive procedure.' The debate on the rule of law in Spain is a perfect example of how this report can spark necessary discussions and raise awareness about the issues that need to be addressed. I would like to remind my fellow members that the report is not meant to be a partisan tool, but rather a constructive instrument to promote the rule of law in all member states. Let us work together to strengthen this report and ensure that it is used to promote democracy and the rule of law, rather than to play national politics."
164555,"Mr. Chairman! Mr. Commissioner! We have another report on breaking the rule of law and you made amendments to it about positive changes in Poland and I would like you to all hear now, what positive changes are introduced in Poland, because in the future you may be concerned with all public media authorities in Poland have a legally provided term of office . Tusk, however, did not want to wait and forcibly took public media without any legal basis and threw out almost all employees, including a pregnant and disabled woman. And the buildings ordered to surround the police. His minister used the forged notarial acts for the whole action, and the prosecutor who detected this was degraded. In the meantime, the unlawfulness of Tusk's actions was confirmed by the courts and the Constitutional Tribunal. Tusk and his people did not follow any judgment, and his minister's decision was considered - I quote - ""non -existent"", because - I also quote - ""does not meet the criteria of importance."" So real lawyers and those people who shouted about the independence of the courts must have a good rip when they hear that the minister's message about the importance is higher than the Act and the Constitution. In addition, Minister of Justice Bodnar throws almost one judge from some function every day. And the question is, did you really want such independence? In addition, Tusk's people took a national prosecutor a moment later. They cannot dismiss him without the president's consent, so they took his office by force. And they turned off the cards to him and his deputies and do not let in the buildings. And you are probably wondering why he does all this for? A moment later it turned out. His people turned the case of the Senate Marshal from Tusk, towards whom 250 people testified that he had demanded a bribe from them. 250 people. Do you know a similar case in the history of the European Union? And you think that these changes are good and lawful. Politics can be perverse. I want to tell you all. And make sure that one day someone would not do it to you here in the European Parliament. The buildings took strength. Turned off the cards. He considered that press releases are higher than the Act. And one more thing. I don't expect any intervention from you. You don't have the right to do so now. You didn't have before. But I want the world to hear about your hypocrisy.",AGAINST,"Mr. Chairman! Mr. Commissioner! I would like to address the concerns raised about the amendments to the report on the Commission’s 2023 Rule of Law report, specifically regarding the positive changes in Poland. While some may argue that the previous government's actions were unlawful, it is essential to acknowledge that the current government has taken steps to address these issues. The fact that public media authorities in Poland now have a legally provided term of office is a significant improvement. Furthermore, the previous government's actions, although deemed unlawful, were a response to the need for reform. We should focus on the progress made rather than dwelling on past controversies. It is also crucial to recognize that the independence of the courts and the prosecutor's office is essential, and the current government's efforts to strengthen these institutions should be acknowledged. Let us not forget that the European Parliament's role is to promote cooperation and understanding, rather than criticizing individual member states. I urge you to consider the positive developments in Poland and support the amendments to the report."
164555,"Mr. President, in the report on the rule of law within the European Union, the Commission and the rapporteur compete to distribute good and bad points around them and shoot red bullets on all those who dare Distring the federalist diktat of Brussels but the same ones who compete to point the shortcomings of others make the deaf ear when it comes to pointing their own. On the 43 pages in the report, only a few lines evoke the lips the occurrence of the very worrying and the great scandal and very important scandal of Qatargate. This scandal which shaken the European Parliament on December 9, 2022 and which has since experienced many twists and turns. The designated corrupter, Qatar, the alleged corrupt, the European deputies, to begin, remember, by Eva Kaïlí, then socialist vice-president of parliament. But who can today certify to us that the extent of the influence and corruption of our institutions by Qatar is limited to the bags filled with cash found in Mrs. Kaïlí? More than a year later, many questions remain unanswered. Worse, other questions have been added to it. But why does the OLAF, does the European Union control body not react? Is there a link, even indirect, between Qatar and subsidies to associations close to the Muslim Brotherhood, like Femysto? Could there be a link between Qatar and the European Union immigrationist policies which help to aggravate Islamist communitarianism on our continent? And why finally, the majority of deputies of this European Parliament refused an internal commission of inquiry? It is more than time to shed light on the influence of Qatar and their relays here, within the European Union and can be even beyond. There is an emergency. Yesterday, the Emir of Qatar was received by Emmanuel Macron at the Élysée and we continue here to close our eyes.",AGAINST,"Mr. President, while some of my colleagues are fixated on the Qatargate scandal, I believe we must not lose sight of the progress made in the Commission's 2023 Rule of Law report. The report does mention the scandal, and it is true that only a few lines are dedicated to it, but this is because the report's primary focus is on the broader rule of law within the European Union. We must not let one scandal overshadow the efforts made to strengthen our institutions and promote the rule of law. Furthermore, the OLAF is indeed investigating the matter, and we must let them do their job without undue pressure or speculation. The European Parliament's decision not to establish an internal commission of inquiry was a democratic one, and we must respect it. Let us focus on the positive aspects of the report and work together to build a stronger, more just European Union."

Because we must worry about respecting the rule of law within certain Member States. And it is however this democratic framework which allows the guarantee of our fundamental freedoms and no state, even less member of the Union, should be able to attack it with impunity. Thus, we must preserve press freedom, public freedoms, as we have recalled in our fight against the use of spy software such as Pegasus. In fact, too many governments play with our fundamental rights, as if they were only adjustment variables. This parliament has also already established many shortcomings within the Member States and the last minute amendments deposited by certain groups will not be able to change the reality of things. So tomorrow, let us make this report adopted for what it contains, for what it represents. But I also think for the hope that he will bring to better tomorrows for our democratic life.",FOR,"Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, Dear colleagues, while I understand the concerns raised in this report, I believe we must approach this issue with caution. The report itself acknowledges that certain Member States are making efforts to preserve press freedom and public freedoms. We must not undermine these efforts by adopting a report that may be perceived as overly critical. Furthermore, the use of spy software such as Pegasus is a complex issue that requires a nuanced approach. We must not rush to judgment and instead work with Member States to address these concerns in a constructive manner. I urge you to consider the potential consequences of adopting this report and instead focus on building a more collaborative and supportive environment within the Union.

By adopting this proposal, we are creating more effective health systems and higher quality care, while always preserving privacy, control and security of the most sensitive information we know. This is a big step towards a European health union, where collaboration transcends borders, innovation is driven and where each European can believe in universal access to health care.",FOR,"Madam President, Madam Commissioner, Dear colleagues, while I understand the potential benefits of the European Health Data Space, I strongly believe that we must consider the risks and challenges associated with it. The same Portuguese citizen who benefits from having their electronic health records accessible in Portugal may also be concerned about their data being scattered across different countries, compromising their right to privacy and data security. We must not underestimate the complexity of ensuring that privacy and data security are indeed top priorities in this process. Furthermore, we risk creating a system where duplication or triplication of resources is merely shifted from one country to another, rather than truly avoiding it.

And, for that, we have introduced guarantees to do so with maximum security, privacy and trust. The citizen will have control of their data and may restrict or decide who can access them and for what. It is an interoperable health data space that will allow better diagnoses and reduce tests and duplicities of tests. But, in addition, the potential is enormous if these data - in a safe, anonymity and with the patient's consent - are made available to medical research.

We risk creating a system where citizens' data is shared across the European Union without sufficient control. Although we have introduced guarantees, the risk of data breaches and misuse remains high. Moreover, the possibility of making patients' data available to medical research, even with their consent, raises concerns about anonymity and the potential for exploitation. Instead of a giant step forward, I fear we may be taking a step back in terms of data protection and citizens' trust. Let us not rush into this decision without thoroughly addressing these concerns."

This also applies to my anonymized health data, which, for example, A pool of anonymized data from all over Europe can be used in research - this can be a real gamuchanger for research, for future treatments, but also for prevention in health crises.

However, the proposed data space would create a vast pool of anonymized data from all over Europe, which could potentially be misused.

Thank you to the reporters for good cooperation. I especially appreciate the extension of patient control over data storage and sharing. Our text also strengthens the supervision and monitoring system for the security of collecting, storing and sharing data at the level of national supervisory authorities. Thus, we managed to seal the provisions of many articles of the Regulation in accordance with the principle that I often pointed out: firstly, data processing security. I am also happy with a reasonable narrowing of the secondary scope of data use. The so-called opt-out option should help build citizens' trust in the system. In the course of upcoming three -sided negotiations, I will support solutions maximally increasing the security of processing this data and minimizing the goals of this processing.

The partnership with Microsoft will enable us to leverage cutting-edge technology to improve healthcare outcomes, and the benefits will far outweigh any perceived risks. Furthermore, the EU's involvement will actually protect Europeans' data from private actors such as banks and insurance companies, who may seek to exploit it for their own gain. By giving Europeans control over their own data, we are empowering them, not controlling them. Let us not forget that the EU is a union of nations working together for the common good, not an empire seeking to impose its will. We must seize this opportunity to create a better, more integrated healthcare system for all Europeans."
168444,"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, we have a very good text a lot in front of us, extremely improved in relation to the plan we received, and I would like to thank the rapporteurs, shadowy rapporteurs and staff for this long -term hard work. But don't stay in the obvious we agree on; the land is turning, so let's move on I would like to put four or five notes that for me and my political team have value in this folder very important elements are for us: First, the possibility of patients to will enable access to their data and retain the right to inform; second, the mechanism for assessment of compliance; third, the prohibition of interconnecting the various wellness and well -being applications with electronic registries; fourth, the drastic restriction of Secondary use of health data to avoid the possibility of discrimination against citizens in all areas of social action; fifth, compliance with registries exclusively within our union and, of course Banks. In closing, although I think the text is much better, improved, I think it's not too late for some final improvement interventions and therefore I invite you to support the points for which we have requested a separate vote.",FOR,"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, while I acknowledge the efforts put into the European Health Data Space proposal, I have to express my reservations about the current text. Although it's improved, I still have concerns about the drastic restriction of secondary use of health data, which could hinder medical research and innovation. Furthermore, the prohibition of interconnecting various wellness and well-being applications with electronic registries might limit the potential benefits of integrated healthcare services. I also worry that the exclusive compliance with registries within our union and banks could create unnecessary barriers to international cooperation in healthcare. I urge you to reconsider these points and support a more balanced approach that weighs the benefits of data protection against the need for medical progress and cooperation."
166177,"– Mr President, Commissioner, dear colleagues, as the first legislation of its kind, the Cyber Resilience Act is much called for and necessary for the security of digital products in the EU internal market Currently, many digital products that originate from third countries are sold in the internal market, but the level of the cybersecurity and possible software updates is unknown The trilogue outcome of the Cyber Resilience Act is a balanced agreement that will provide better consumer protection and boost also fair competition It will ensure that all digital products that are put on the EU market, both hardware and software, are cyber-secure throughout their whole life cycle and will receive security updates Promoting innovation is crucial for ensuring European competitiveness. We need to make sure that our smallest enterprises are not faced with an overly heavy administrative burden. Necessary flexibility and legal certainty is needed for small businesses to operate and grow. The CRA will ensure that our micro- and small enterprises are supported, especially through training and in conformity assessment procedures. The number of cyberattacks is consistently growing and they are becoming more sophisticated every day. Small businesses and critical institutions are targeted by cybercriminals. Cybersecurity concerns all sectors of society. Common rules and standards can significantly reduce vulnerabilities and risks related to digital products. Cybersecurity by design can help ensure our overall security. I would like to thank our rapporteur, Mr Danti, and all the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation on this very important file.",FOR,"– Mr President, Commissioner, dear colleagues, while I understand the intentions behind the Cyber Resilience Act, I strongly believe that it may not be the solution we are looking for. The Act's requirement for all digital products to be cyber-secure throughout their whole life cycle and receive security updates may impose an overly heavy administrative burden on our smallest enterprises, hindering their ability to operate and grow. Furthermore, the Act's emphasis on conformity assessment procedures may not provide the necessary flexibility for small businesses to innovate and adapt to the rapidly changing cybersecurity landscape. Instead of promoting innovation, the CRA may stifle it. I urge caution and careful consideration of the potential unintended consequences of this legislation."
166177,"Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner Breton, honorable colleagues, finally law on Ciberresilienza arrives in the plenary for 2030, more than 120 billion related objects are expected, a rapid figure over time of the internet of things and artificial intelligence. These objects help us in daily life: I think of home automation, smart appliances, medical devices connected on the net and, when they are integrated with production processes, allow you to make leaps forward in innovation and competitiveness. Precision agriculture is an example. The intelligent objects are useful but vulnerable and must be defended by the increasingly frequent IT attacks, such as the undue appropriation of data, the online fraud, the boycott of critical infrastructures, as we have often seen in the hospital and health. This in a geopolitical scenario where IT attacks are increasingly hybrid war tool. Without forgetting the economic damage, especially for small and medium -sized enterprises: in Europe almost two out of three companies declare that in the event of a computer attack they would risk bankruptcy. A specificity, this, which I wanted to be recognized by this law, with the provision of support measures starting from training programs, support for the tests of products and simplified procedures for the evaluation of their conformity. It is therefore important to systematically identify vulnerability and threats and protect citizens and businesses. This new European law, of which I am a speaker for the group of socialists and democrats, allows us to do so by exploiting the size of the single market to give more timely and coordinated answers. In fact, the weaker ring safety is in fact the security of everyone. We have established common rules for the digital products for the first time, whether imported, where encrypted has been important since the design. The new rules provide for the obligation for manufacturers to provide updates and information and, moreover, to report the competent authorities and applied solutions to the competent authorities. But making laws is not enough if the awareness of each of us does not increase. The safety of the objects connected on the net starts from us and from the development of the skills necessary at all levels. Here we have to accelerate because the current one, of almost one million jobs, must be filled and represents a great opportunity especially for our young people. Then strength with the training, which we wanted to write clearly in the regulation, and now we must ensure that this goal translates into adequate projects and funds. Dear colleagues - I also thank the speaker and the correlators of this law - with this law on encrypted we have written a good page for a safe and inclusive digital transition. It is a story that we will have to continue writing together!",FOR,"Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner Breton, honorable colleagues, I understand the enthusiasm behind the Cyber Resilience Act, but I must express my concerns regarding its potential impact. While it is true that the internet of things and artificial intelligence bring many benefits, such as home automation and precision agriculture, we must not overlook the economic damage that this law may cause, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises. The provision of support measures, such as training programs and simplified procedures for conformity evaluation, may not be enough to offset the costs of implementing these new rules. Moreover, the obligation for manufacturers to provide updates and information may lead to a significant increase in costs, which could ultimately be passed on to consumers. Furthermore, the law's focus on the single market may create a weaker link in the safety chain, as imported products may not be subject to the same level of scrutiny. I urge my colleagues to consider these concerns and to ensure that the benefits of this law are not outweighed by its potential drawbacks. We must not rush into this law without careful consideration of its impact on our businesses and citizens."
166177,"– Mr President, dear Commissioner, colleagues, thanks to the pressure that’s been put in this House, these European Union buildings like this one are fully equipped with Western hard- and software But our colleagues in the African Union were less fortunate Their building is fully equipped with Chinese equipment and, demonstrably, that is being spied and being used against them in their own buildings Now, last week, malicious software was discovered in our ports and harbours, here in our vital infrastructure. There’s plenty of concerns – all European intelligence agencies have these concerns about Chinese hard- and software, for example, being leveraged in their offensive espionage program – leveraged against us. So we need legislation, and this week we vote on the cybersecurity legislation of hard- and software products in a very good law. Also, because of your support, but also because we, in Parliament, introduced measures that enable the European Commission to impose market limitation, market restrictions to risky vendors and products because our citizens demand security, which means concrete decoupling. So the basis for decoupling and de-risking – sorry, not decoupling, but de-risking – is now here and now we need the full force of the European Commission to execute and keep us safe.",FOR,"Mr President, dear Commissioner, colleagues, while I understand the concerns about Chinese hard- and software, I believe we must be cautious not to overreact. We should not rush into imposing market restrictions on vendors and products without thorough investigation. Our citizens demand security, but they also demand a free and open market. We risk decoupling ourselves from the global economy and hindering innovation if we impose unnecessary restrictions. Furthermore, we should not forget that our colleagues in the African Union chose to equip their building with Chinese equipment, and we should respect their sovereignty. Let us not forget the importance of cooperation and diplomacy in addressing cybersecurity concerns. I urge the European Commission to exercise restraint and consider the potential consequences of overregulation."
166177,"Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner Breton, honorable colleagues, cybersiculia is a fundamental priority for Europe in the digital world today every day critical infrastructures, businesses and European citizens are exposed to increasingly sophisticated cybernetic threats; It is a vast matter, which has large facets that deserve to be treated by the European Union as a priority, both for today and for tomorrow. The law on ciberresilienza, which colleague Nicola Danti as a speaker has negotiated in an excellent way with the Council and the Commission, is in fact the first European law on the cybersicacy of the products that can be connected online. In these months of work we have managed to fill some gaps, making sure that any digital product is not only safe throughout the supply chain, but above all during its life cycle. Transparency, support and guarantee are the fulcrum of this regulation, which, on the one hand, will protect the consumer and, on the other, will support small and medium -sized enterprises. Particular attention was given to the management of vulnerabilities, with more transparency and cooperation but always in compliance with the circulation of data, especially technical, and with a strengthening of Enisa in the control process. A regulation that applies to most of the products that ourselves, at this moment, are using here in the classroom and which therefore should make us understand the importance of this vote.",FOR,"Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner Breton, honorable colleagues, while I understand the importance of addressing cyber threats in the digital world, I have concerns about the proposed Cyber Resilience Act. The regulation may impose additional burdens on small and medium-sized enterprises, which could hinder their growth and competitiveness. Furthermore, the emphasis on transparency and cooperation in managing vulnerabilities may compromise the circulation of technical data, potentially creating new risks. We must carefully consider the potential consequences of this regulation on our businesses and citizens before moving forward. I urge caution and further examination of the potential impact of this law on our economy and society."
166177,"Dear president, dear commissioner, dear colleagues, we have greatly debated cybersecurity, technologies, processes and measures to prevent cybercrime. We don't talk so much about what happens when these barriers are insufficient - the huge loss of time and money caused by these attacks. In Portugal, cybership increased 23 %, starting to seriously compromise the security of business systems and data and other societies. CIBER - Resilience precisely means the ability to maintain operating systems, with a minimum of impact on efficiency, when the unexpected happens - not only cybership, but also other unforeseen events, such as natural disasters. The text we prepare to approve seeks to establish this complementarity between cybersecurity and cyber - resilience. The proposal offers a proper balance between the proposed objectives and the concern to avoid an administrative overload, namely for SMEs and commercial use software. The application of the law, within three years, gives companies the time to prepare.",FOR,"Dear president, dear commissioner, dear colleagues, while we acknowledge the importance of cybersecurity, we must consider the potential consequences of rushing into the Cyber Resilience Act. The proposed law may indeed establish a balance between objectives and administrative concerns, but we risk placing an undue burden on SMEs and commercial use software developers. The three-year implementation period may seem sufficient, but it may not be enough time for all companies to prepare, particularly in light of the increasing complexity of cyber threats. In Portugal, the 23% increase in cybercrime is alarming, but we must not compromise the competitiveness of our businesses in the name of cyber resilience. We must carefully weigh the potential benefits against the potential costs and consider alternative solutions that do not place an excessive administrative burden on our companies."
166177,"Mr. President, the Commissioner, first of all, congratulations to the rapporteur Nicola Danti, of our political family, for the excellent work he led on this file. A job that aims to answer a simple question, in fact: how to better protect our connected products? Perhaps you have a connected camera at home to monitor your newborn, a connected toy or a connected car? All these objects can be hacked: your privacy can be revealed, money can be extorted to you ... This is where this European law comes in, which will protect you, you, your families, but also our companies, which use Always more connected objects. Faced with those who want less Europe, we have a concrete example here because we need more Europe, a Europe that protects people and protects our digital life.",FOR,"Mr. President, I understand the intentions behind the Cyber Resilience Act, but I fear it may be an example of overreaching by the EU. While it's true that connected products can be hacked, revealing our privacy and putting us at risk of extortion, do we really need more Europe to solve this issue? Shouldn't we be cautious of creating more bureaucracy and regulations that might stifle innovation in our companies? Perhaps we should focus on empowering individuals and companies to take responsibility for their own digital security rather than relying on EU legislation to protect us."
168434,"Mr. President, in today's debate on the economic governance in the last plenary of this legislature, we emphasize again on the importance of fiscal policies, monetary strategies and financial regulations meant to ensure stability and growth in the euro area but I am glad that these discussions also involves Budget discipline, structural reforms and measures to approach economic disappearances between Member States. We must strengthen the internal market, the capital, to emphasize competitiveness, we need an industrial pact, and I also say it as president of the ITRE Commission, and on the strengthening of our economic actors of all dimensions and yes, from all regions of the Union. We need clear rules, clear implementation and a reasonable balance between reducing excessive debt and allowing investments. This was the compass of the PPE group when contouring the new fiscal rules for the Member States of the European Union and this must continue to be the compass of the new Parliament. Solid finances and sustainable levels of debt remain essential, especially given the recent increase in the cost of public loans. The new framework is a solid basis for the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union and I believe that these rules will make the future more predictable. Solid financing remains a priority and, here, the involvement of institutions such as the European Central Bank and the European Commission is necessary and important, to reduce the burden for the Member States and to really strengthen fiscal policy.",FOR,"Mr. President, while I agree on the importance of fiscal policies and financial regulations for stability and growth in the euro area, I strongly believe that the proposed economic governance requirements for budgetary frameworks of the Member States may not be the right approach. We risk creating an over-reliance on institutions such as the European Central Bank and the European Commission, which could lead to a loss of autonomy for Member States in their fiscal policy decisions. Furthermore, the emphasis on reducing excessive debt may hinder investments, which are crucial for competitiveness and economic growth. A more balanced approach would be to allow Member States more flexibility in their budgetary frameworks, while still ensuring stability and growth in the euro area. We should not forget that the recent increase in the cost of public loans is a concern, but it should not lead us to impose overly restrictive rules on Member States. A more nuanced approach is needed, one that takes into account the diversity of economic situations and needs across the Union."
168434,"Mr. President, Commission, it is a pleasure to conclude this mandate with this vote and with this debate because in this legislature we have lived - as both commissioners remembered - complicated moments: the pandemic or the beginning of the Putin war in Ukraine both challenges demanded flexibility from the fiscal point of view and that we took time to allow an answer that maintained the activity in those difficult times. But it is also true that we cannot continue without norms; We need to have rules that guide tax policies. I am glad - first - of the broad consensus to reject the previous norms that forced an austericide after the financial crisis of a little more than a decade, and that the consensus to reject those rules allowed to illuminate a new agreement towards a Soft reduction in debt according to the situation of each state. I trust that this is and that this Parliament will closely supervise the application of these norms in the next legislature.",FOR,"Mr. President, Commission, I understand the desire for rules to guide tax policies, but I fear that the proposed norms for budgetary frameworks of the Member States may stifle the flexibility that we so desperately needed during the pandemic and the Putin war in Ukraine. The previous norms may have been too austere, but the new agreement towards a soft reduction in debt may not provide enough fiscal discipline. I urge caution and careful consideration of the potential consequences of these norms, and I hope that this Parliament will not rush into adopting them without thorough scrutiny."

These are conditions to allow the Member States to reduce their debt level without slowing down the essential investments to meet the challenges of tomorrow Europe can only strengthen its sovereignty if it is credible on the budgetary plan, credible with Future generations and our partners, credible to continue investing in Europeans in our common priorities I regret that certain oppositions are pretending to confuse austerity and responsibility. What are these new rules? It is a personalization of the objectives for each Member State, depending on its budgetary situation, in order to get it out of deleveraging, and incentives for reforms and investments in the climate, digital and defense transition. Again, the oppositions will shine by their irresponsibility and prove their inability to govern. Not to vote for this reform is to consider that the pact, in its formula currently in force, is satisfactory: this is not my case.",FOR,"Mr. President, Gentlemen, the commissioners, I strongly oppose the update of the internal regulations of our economic governance. The proposed rules will lead to austerity measures disguised as responsibility, slowing down essential investments for the challenges of tomorrow. By personalizing objectives for each Member State, we risk creating unequal conditions that may hinder some countries' ability to invest in their priorities. The incentives for reforms and investments in climate, digital, and defense transition are not enough to justify the potential negative impact on our economy. Not voting for this reform does not mean the current pact is satisfactory, but rather that we should strive for a more balanced approach that promotes growth and investment without compromising our sovereignty. Let us not rush into a decision that may have far-reaching consequences for the future of Europe."

Well, we will soon know it, because in two hours will be the most important vote of the whole legislature, the vote for or against austerity. If you vote today in favor of austerity, enter your posters and caliots now, absent from social networks. The electoral campaign is over, because you will not be able to hold any of your promises, simply because you will have created the conditions for your own political helplessness. Contrary to what you say, gentlemen, commissioners, contrary to what the rapporteurs and those who support them tell, to vote for these new budgetary rules is to impose a force of force on all European states is to confiscate them all The financial means essential to guarantee an economic, social, climatic and geopolitical future to our union. Liberal colleagues will not be able to finance business aid. Socialist colleagues will not be able to finance an improvement in public services. Frankly, when I hear people talk about flexibility and margin for investment, I say to myself: ""But we are in Orwell, here!"" Peace is war. Freedom is bondage. Words don't want to say anything anymore. It’s a sham. I have absolutely no heart to joke. For the last time, I ask you: reject these unjust and deadly rules. You only have a few hours left to pull yourself together.",AGAINST,"Mr. President, dear colleagues, I strongly disagree with the notion that the proposed budgetary rules will lead to austerity and confiscate financial means from European states. In fact, these rules aim to provide a framework for responsible and sustainable economic governance. By supporting these rules, we are not imposing a straitjacket on member states, but rather giving them the flexibility and margin for investment they need to guarantee a strong economic, social, climatic, and geopolitical future. Let us not be misled by empty promises of electoral campaigns. We must think about the long-term benefits of a stable and prosperous Europe. Voting in favor of these rules is not a vote against business aid or public services, but rather a vote for a responsible and sustainable approach to economic governance. I urge you to support these rules and ensure a bright future for our union."
168434,"Chairman, Commissioner, colleagues, budget rules aim to pursue healthy public finances in the interest of our society and our economy. They must ensure that future generations are not saddled with the consequences of excessive debt accrual, and this is often forgotten today - A monetary Union simply cannot survive without budgetary discipline The new budget rules that are currently ongoing offer flexibility, so that important investments, in infrastructure and defense, can continue for example. At the same time, they also impose discipline, but that will only happen if the committee is willing to also remove the stick if necessary. I fear that that will not happen sufficiently. One must be able to intervene in a credible and effective way if the budget of a Member State derails, as is very clear today in my home base Belgium. Opting for more debt building at European level is an irresponsible flight ahead. Now that more and more Member States are at the end of their Latin in terms of budget and debt, they are going to bring the claim economy into a new and dangerous phase. That is irresponsible. If countries have insufficient budget capacity, the answer is not the building of debt at the European level, but a well -considered remediation, linked to growth -imulating reforms. Take Ireland: twelve years ago 120% debt Bbp, now 40%. How? By more or less balancing the budget, reforming and stimulating growth. It is that simple.",AGAINST,"Chairman, Commissioner, colleagues, while I agree that budget rules are essential for a healthy economy, I believe that the current proposal for economic governance does not go far enough in addressing the challenges faced by Member States. The flexibility offered by the new budget rules is a step in the right direction, but it is not enough. We must be willing to consider more debt building at the European level as a means of supporting Member States that are struggling. The example of Ireland is often cited, but we must not forget that every country is unique and what works for one may not work for another. In fact, Ireland's success can also be attributed to the support it received from the European Union during its time of need. By opting for more debt building at the European level, we can provide a safety net for Member States and prevent them from being forced into austerity measures that can have devastating consequences for their citizens. Let us not be afraid to take bold action and consider all options available to us."

Thirty years after Maastricht, it is clear that the EU's economic governance has been ineffective in achieving low inflation and strict household rules. However, this does not mean we should abandon the principles of a hard currency and a central bank that protects savings and small assets. Instead, we should build upon the successes of the Next Generation EU debt program and implement a permanent and inflationary debt mechanism at the EU level. This would allow us to finance green and social projects that are essential for our competitiveness in the global economy. High taxes and inflation in Germany and Northern Europe would be a small price to pay for a more united and prosperous Europe.

That it was necessary at all costs to enter the nails of the 3% deficit and 60% of debt? That a good note from the rating agencies is well worth a huge social racketeering of Europeans? We had to make their pockets, rather than taxing great fortunes and superprofits? Whatever the sacrifices, it will actually be never enough for you. This is what you condemn us with the vote of these budgetary rules: perpetuity austerity. This is how, together, the socialists, the liberals and the right are in the process of solving our future, our public services, our social protection and even the environment. But if there is something that is negotiated, it is debt, not the planet. See also how the French government is already having a great time with its Lépine assistance of the worst ideas to deprive the French of everything they have most precious: hospitals, schools, public transport, unemployment insurance, function public, ecological investments ... Everything, absolutely everything will undergo the assaults of the austerity bulldozer. Destroy the social state to better cajolate capital. Saborate the ecological bifurcation to run the money pump. We have been alone to oppose this hemicycle to your burnt earth economic policy. So, on June 9, we definitively stop your damage, before they are irreversible.",AGAINST,"Mr. President, dear colleagues, let us not forget the importance of a stable economy for the benefit of our citizens. A 3% deficit and 60% debt are not just arbitrary numbers, but a necessary framework to ensure the long-term sustainability of our public services and social protection. By supporting these budgetary rules, we are not condemning our people to perpetual austerity, but rather making responsible decisions to avoid burdening future generations with unbearable debt. The French government's efforts to reform and streamline its public services are a step in the right direction. We must prioritize sound economic governance over short-term gains and populist rhetoric. Let us work together to create a prosperous and stable future for all Europeans, rather than risking our economic stability for fleeting political gains."
163628,"– Madam President, Commission Presidency, I will start with a quote from a former Belgian Prime Minister and founding father of the EPP Wilfried Martens once said: ‘There will be only an ambitious Europe or no Europe at all’ And at the beginning of this electoral year, we proved this. Ursula von der Leyen has demonstrated together with us in the last years that we are ambitious on climate policy, the Brexit agreement, COVID vaccines, RRF, Ukraine support and the migration policy. The EPP is not building castles in the air like some of the left are doing, and we are not having a wrecking ball in our hand like the radical right is doing. The EPP’s Europe is an ambitious Europe and we deliver. I want to thank for this. The European Council in December showed leadership: yes to Ukraine, yes to Ursula von der Leyen’s proposal on enlargement to start the negotiations, especially with Ukraine. This was an historic decision and gives certainty to the Ukrainian people. Yes, you can be part of our family. Yes, it’s worth to fight against Putin. Yes, Ukraine must win the war. But the European Council also failed when it was about the money – to create certainty on our long-term financing of the European Union. And yes, there is a question now with Viktor Orbán and Hungary on the table. For us, as the European Parliament, it was a huge success in this mandate to establish a binding rule of law mechanism. It was our common effort, our common success. For us, as the EPP, it was always important to have a fact-based assessment about rule of law in individual cases. And for us now, the important thing is that we need further clarification. As the EPP, we initiated a letter to ask in the BUDG Committee and also in the CONT Committee about the reasoning behind the decision of the Commission. And we are welcoming Commissioners Schmit, Reynders and Commissioner Hahn to inform us about this. That’s the next step in front of us. Hungary has for a long time here in this Parliament been seen as a difficult case. We have initiated an Article 7 case against Hungary. And if I may say so, it’s great to hear the Council telling us that the Commission decision must be assessed. But the most important thing – what I would love to see from the Council side – is to answer our request on Article 7, because that is on the table and until now the leaders had no courage, and obviously no time even, to discuss the Hungarian case on substance on the Council side. So please answer the demand from Parliament. The question now on the table for Ukraine is how to pay teachers, how to pay nurses, doctors and all of the soldiers? How to convince our American friends and the IMF to continue supporting Ukraine? Having this in mind, the end of January Council must deliver. We must be prepared for all options at the end of this month and we, as the EPP, also insist on the other elements on the MFF: don’t forget about migration, for example. At the beginning of 2024, I want also to speak about the broader perspective. An ambitious approach is needed – I said it. What do we have to do? First of all, we have to come back to a very old idea in Europe. Belgium had already ratified the European Defence Union before it was stopped by the French National Assembly in 1953, nine years after the end of the Second World War. Another former Belgian Prime Minister and former NATO Secretary General, Paul-Henri Spaak, said rightly afterwards: ‘There are only two types of states in Europe: small states and states that have not yet realised that they are small’. Europe must stand united against Putin. Now it’s the right moment to build up a European defence pillar. We cannot have 180 different weapon systems while the US only has 30. Imagine how much we could increase our defence capabilities only with the introduction of a single market for defence systems. Let’s build up our own defence capabilities in the next years, for example, with a European missile defence shield, a cyber-brigade or even a nuclear shield. With ambitious investments in European defence, we can keep the biggest promise of Europe, and that is a promise of peace. Alongside defence, migration is a second important pillar for our family. We have to finally complete now this legislation. Le Pen, AfD and Orbán are trying to torpedo the European solution because they want to use the substance of this problem for their egoistic political benefit. They don’t want to solve the problem. They are the problem. And that’s why we must finalise this legislation. And my appeal today goes especially to the Greens. I understand that they are not yet decided whether they can support the final outcome of this migration deal. Imagine for a second the Migration Act failing in this House. Imagine for a second. That would mean that we help Le Pen, AfD and FPÖ, that we would fuel extremists all over Europe. And that’s why it’s now the moment to take over responsibility and finalise this migration deal And the last point I want to mention is economic issues for us as the EPP. This will be the driving issue for this election campaign – to have jobs, to have good incomes, to have prosperity, to have a strong economy. Germany is already in recession and we need not another European traffic light coalition. What we need is economic strength for Europe and that is what the EPP will be asking for.",AGAINST,"Honorable members of the Parliament, I rise to express my concerns about the proposal on the situation in Hungary and frozen EU funds. While I understand the importance of upholding the rule of law, I believe we must proceed with caution and not jump to conclusions. The EPP's call for further clarification on the Commission's decision is well-founded, and I agree that we should not rush to judgment. However, I disagree with the EPP's stance on linking the Hungarian case to the broader issues of migration and defense. These are complex problems that require careful consideration and should not be used as leverage in our dealings with Hungary. Furthermore, I am concerned that the proposed measures could have unintended consequences, such as exacerbating tensions within the EU and undermining our unity in the face of external threats. Let us focus on finding a solution that is fair, proportionate, and respectful of the sovereignty of all member states. Let us work together to build a stronger, more united Europe, rather than resorting to punitive measures that may ultimately harm our common interests."
163628,"– Madam President, Council, dear President von der Leyen, colleagues, I want to start by saying that whoever leads the Council on its special meeting on the 1st of February needs to show enough strength and leadership to overcome the blackmail of Orbán and deliver on the EU budget and the support to Ukraine Europe is yet again at an existential moment. Europeans are looking at us. European leaders need to show that they can actually be respected by our citizens and the whole world. Who could tell that through this mandate, our geopolitical Europe would indeed be tested so much? Yes, we delivered in the vaccines altogether, but too many of them were sold to the developed world while the rest of the world was looking at us in agony. Yes, we delivered with resolve to the Ukrainians for these two years, including by opening the negotiations for accession just a month ago. But when the US are starting to falter, we are not yet filling the gap, even if it is our security, our values and our freedom that is being fought for on those fields. We are taking too long to create our own strategic autonomy in a world that is much more confrontational now. We are giving in to the blackmail of Orbán, and all the bullies in Europe are rejoicing with that. The Europeans are suffering and the populists, they are laughing at it because they will grow from anger and frustration, turning suffering and fear into hatred. And now, at this critical moment, we are faced with a proposal to eventually start cutting our policies that can help those that are suffering to pay for the interests of Next Generation EU. We cannot do more, like helping Ukrainians or all the correct priorities you identified, Madam President, with less, at the cost of other policies like cohesion policy. Europeans want fair transitions and better housing for all. They want to reinforce our social economic model, not to see it endangered by austerity policies imposed by the Council. We will fight as a parliament for social convergence and sustainable investment in the new fiscal rules. The populists, the neo-fascists, the anti-Europeans that now you worry about, Mr Weber, those are coming now out of every corner. They are raising their arms into the open air, fuelling from people’s frustrations. The Europeans are asking us, where is Brussels when we need it? This is a defining moment. Europe needs to find strength and the will to fight hatred yet again.",AGAINST,"Madam President, Council, dear President von der Leyen, colleagues, I strongly believe that we must consider the concerns of all member states, including Hungary, in our decision-making process. We cannot simply give in to the pressure of delivering on the EU budget and supporting Ukraine without taking into account the potential consequences of our actions. The fact that we delivered vaccines and showed resolve to the Ukrainians is a testament to our strength, but we must not let our desire to project our values and freedom cloud our judgment. We must be cautious not to create a power vacuum that can be exploited by bullies in Europe. The proposal to cut our policies to pay for the interests of Next Generation EU may be a necessary evil to ensure the long-term sustainability of our economic model. We must prioritize fiscal responsibility and avoid imposing undue burdens on our citizens. The Europeans are not asking for more handouts, but for responsible governance. We must not let the populists and anti-Europeans exploit our weaknesses, but rather show them that we can make tough decisions for the greater good. This is a defining moment for Europe, and we must choose prudence over populism."
163628,"– Madam President, I ask of Ms von der Leyen, can I ask you a very simple question? That is, are you going to repeat the practice that happened during the previous European Council in December? You remember that? The blackmail by Viktor Orbán to use the veto And then just before that European Council, the freezing of I think it was 11 billion, in exchange for the fact that he left the room That was the deal: ‘11 billion and you leave the room’ So my question to you is, are you going to do that again? Because it could happen on 1 February That is, that he again uses his veto, now for another thing, not for the accession negotiations, but for liberating the 50 billion of funds that are desperately needed for Ukraine  And I have to tell you very openly, before you answer, that if your answer is a yes, then you will run, I think, into big troubles here in this Parliament, not only with me, not only with my group, but I think with the vast majority of this Parliament. I have to tell you, giving in to the blackmail of Orbán like it happened in December has to stop now. And also the compromises that have been put on the table to make a yearly portion of that money or to give a mid-term review on that money, or not a compromise, because it’s simply opening the door for more blackmailing, by Orbán in the coming years.  So, the appeal that I want to launch to you, hopefully, I think, in the name of the vast majority of this parliament is stay inside the treaties, and pick up your role that you have as the guardian of the treaties, because there are sufficient solutions to give this money to Ukraine inside the provisions of the treaty of today. You don’t need to, every time, give in to the blackmail of Orbán. You could propose a face-saving emergency clause or break, like we call, it at 27. That could be a solution. Or you could go into an enhanced cooperation, with 26, under the control of the European Parliament, because enhanced cooperation is controlled by the European Parliament. Or ultimately, you can indeed propose to the Council to take away the voting rights based on Article 7(2) of the Treaty, so that we can decide with unanimity on 26. That’s another proposal.  Anyway, I know I have a very bad reputation in this House, and maybe also with you, I don’t know. And I have also, from time to time, a bad character. I’m sometimes even replaced in my positions. But can I ask you one thing – to be a little bit of all that concerning Orbán? And finally, the battle on Hungary is not a battle on Hungary; it’s a battle on the liberal democracy in Europe. And that battle, we need to win it and not to give in on it.",AGAINST,"– Madam President, I understand the concerns about the situation in Hungary, but I strongly believe that freezing EU funds is not the solution. As we all know, Viktor Orbán has shown willingness to compromise in the past, as seen in the deal made during the previous European Council in December. I think it's unfair to label this as blackmail, when in fact it was a negotiation that led to a mutually beneficial outcome. By freezing funds, we risk isolating Hungary and pushing them further away from our values. Instead, I propose that we explore the compromises that have been put on the table, such as a yearly portion of the funds or a mid-term review. These solutions can help to address the concerns of both Hungary and the EU, while also ensuring that Ukraine receives the support it needs. Let's work together to find a solution that strengthens our unity and promotes liberal democracy in Europe, rather than driving a wedge between us."
163628,"– Madam President, dear colleagues, dear representatives of the Council and the Commission Sometimes in politics, it is worthwhile to take a step back and to look at the bigger picture, and sometimes I ask myself how the European Union looks to others from the outside We stood together in difficult times during the COVID-19 pandemic When Russia brutally invaded Ukraine, we stood at the side of Ukraine and we stood united We should actually right now be considered a strong and meaningful actor in the world, but unfortunately we are not. We are considered too disunited and, by many, also too weak. That is mostly due to one person, one man who we let do whatever he pleases to get what he wants, who we let blackmail and ridicule the rest of the European Union – Viktor Orbán. He attacks minorities, he dismantles press freedom, he dismantles the independence of the judiciary, he weakens Europe, and he disables Europe’s ability to act now vis-à-vis Ukraine. But I can tell you, China is closely watching, obviously, the US and the rest of the world. All for his friend Vladimir Putin and his own pockets. What do the other Member States do? They sit by and let it happen. Big names, important people, presidents, chancellors, prime ministers, they are all too hesitant to do something about it, including the Council President, who has not delivered on something that this Parliament has been asking for for many years now, and that is to move ahead with an Article 7 procedure. What else will you let happen – Hungary becoming even more of an autocracy? Europe becoming weaker and weaker for its own citizens because we are not delivering on the tasks that the citizens demand for the support of Ukraine? Seriously, colleagues, time is up. Ukrainians are losing their lives. Ukrainians are fighting for our freedom too, and we have Putin’s best servant sitting at the table in the European Council, blocking our support and our credibility at this crucial stage. This is a joke, and this is a very bad joke, especially when the Member States actually have the tools to stop this, and not with difficult legal constructions for the financial help of Ukraine – I’m not against it if it is the only way – or to have a proposal for an even dirtier compromise with Orbán. No, the way would be very simply by moving ahead with the Article 7 procedure, not only to defend the rule of law and democracy in Europe, but to make Europe strong in this crucial battle between democracy and autocracy. It is time to do something and the Council has to deliver.",FOR,"– Madam President, dear colleagues, I understand the concerns raised about Hungary, but I urge caution in our approach. We must not forget that Hungary is a valued member of our European family. We stood united during the COVID-19 pandemic and in support of Ukraine, and we should not let internal disagreements undermine our unity. Instead of rushing into an Article 7 procedure, let us focus on finding a compromise that addresses our concerns while preserving the integrity of our Union. We have the tools to support Ukraine, and we should use them in a way that is effective and sustainable. Let us not create unnecessary divisions and instead work towards a solution that strengthens our Union and our ability to act in the face of external challenges. We owe it to our citizens and to the Ukrainians who are fighting for our freedom to find a way forward that is constructive and respectful of our diversity."
163628,"Lady president, lady president von der leyen, honorable colleagues, the balance of the last European council is, in our opinion, in chiaroscuro we are satisfied with the work that has been done on the enlargement to the western Balkans and on the start of the negotiations for the The entry of Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova Giusta, among other things, the proposal to use the frozen funds for Russia to finance the reconstruction of Ukraine. But some question marks on various issues remain and the revision of the financial framework 2021-2027, on which one has not yet been able to find the necessary unanimity, is still open. Here, the enlargement of the European Union to new nations is certainly important, also because, as often affirmed by President Meloni, it would be more correct to speak of the reunification of Europe. There is a cultural identity, in fact, which even comes before political identity and there is a need to make a common front in the face of the difficult geopolitical challenges of these years. This is why we must not make the tragic error of removing nations that are already part of the European Union, as happened with Great Britain and as it risks happening again. To be even clearer, I find the constant attack on Hungary which, even today, in here, is pouring against her. A political bombing that spares nothing and nobody, not even to Hungarian students who, if an amendment had not been approved yesterday, would have been excluded from the Erasmus program. And this despite the steps forward made by the Magian institutions in the relationship with the Commission, for example regarding the reform of justice. I believe that it should be expected from the institutions of Budapest major solidarity and sharing, but I believe that in return they should offer more willingness to listen to their reasons and the right serenity of judgment. The European Union must be cohesive inside and must regain that centrality in the international chessboard that has lost or that perhaps has never really had. To the old issues related to denatality, to the loss of competitiveness, to the management of migratory flows, many others were added: Chinese and Russian expansionism, Middle Eastern crisis, supply of raw materials and energy, artificial intelligence. President, colleagues, we are already in the election campaign and it would be hypocritical to deny it, but Europe is or is something larger than our small political skills, or it is nothing.",AGAINST,"Lady president, honorable colleagues, I strongly disagree with the notion that we should be lenient towards Hungary. While it is true that the European Union must be cohesive and regain its centrality on the international stage, we cannot ignore the steps backward made by the Hungarian institutions in the relationship with the Commission. The fact that they have made some progress on the reform of justice is not enough to justify the constant attack on the EU's values and principles. I believe that the European Union must stand firm in its defense of democracy, the rule of law, and human rights. The frozen funds should not be used to finance Hungary's disregard for these values. Instead, we should use them to support the countries that are truly committed to the European project, such as Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova. We must not make the mistake of rewarding those who undermine our unity and cohesion. Let us stand strong in our defense of European values and not give in to the pressure of those who seek to divide us."
163628,"Lady president, honorable colleagues, happy new year to all! Today I would have liked to talk about the topics discussed to the last European council, however, as colleague Procaccini said, we are and we enter an electoral year and how much I heard today from colleagues forces me and gives me the opportunity to make a wider political reasoning on What will be this year, what they represent and represent the European elections of 2024 from what I feel the premises are no good no one today denies that next year it will be even more difficult than those already difficult we have passed, but in this election campaign , and in the European councils, I would like to hear from the priorities and difficulties that today European citizens face and do not always find us behind the accusation to the parties that I, here in this classroom, represent. I have heard of the populist danger, every plenary session we have absurd debates on the danger of the parties that I represent, but we struggle and above all those who have governed these institutions in the last 30 years ago struggles to understand that the success of the parties that I represent is the result of the your mistakes. It is the result of the policies that you have carried out in the last 30 years; It is also the result of what is then revealed in the meetings of the Council, that is, of a divided Europe that, instead of focusing on a shared method, strength of the positions that then create divisions. We did not do anything extraordinary, we only filled a political space that you have left empty, that you have decided not to fill. Answers to the citizens that we are giving and you have not given your policies. So the problem is not to accuse those who have not ruled of being inefficient or of being dangerous, today the problem you should talk about is the failure of your policies, because if we are voted, we who have never governed in Europe is obviously because i Citizens are not happy and do not feel protected by those who governed today in Europe. 2024 will be very important. As a representative of this political group, I am happy today and I look at the future with optimism because we have already won. What we discuss in this classroom was the result of the fact that our political action led the majority to Europe to discuss certain topics, to talk about immigration, to talk about economy, to approve a reform of the stability and growth pact That finally, even if it is not the best possible, the perspective changes. So a wish to all of a good election campaign and a suggestion: focus on some self -criticism rather than criticizing those who do not want to destroy Europe, but want to free it for years of bad governance.",AGAINST,"Lady president, honorable colleagues, I would like to offer a different perspective on the situation. While some of my colleagues may focus on criticizing the current state of European governance, I believe it's essential to acknowledge the progress we've made in the last 30 years. The success of certain parties is not solely the result of our mistakes, but also of a complex interplay of factors, including the challenges posed by immigration and the economy. Rather than accusing each other of being inefficient or dangerous, we should focus on building on our achievements and addressing the concerns of European citizens together. The reform of the stability and growth pact is a step in the right direction, and I believe we should continue to work towards a more united and effective Europe. Let us focus on self-reflection and constructive criticism, rather than trying to 'free' Europe from what we perceive as 'bad governance.' A good election campaign should be about presenting our vision for a better Europe, not tearing each other down."
163628,"Madam President, Madam Minister, Mrs. Von Der Leyen, The results are final the reality, it is that you are yielding to the whims of M Orban you play the game of this institutional hostage taking organized by Hungary which blocks help in Ukraine and prevents the revision of the European budget but we will speak frankly. It would be a bit easy to hide behind the escapades of the Hungarian president. We have been saying it for a while now: this European budget is completely insufficient to live up to the social and environmental challenges of the moment. And faced with that, you systematically refused our proposals to increase European Union resources, for example, at random, by putting the multinational and richest that continue, year after year, to raise indecent sums . I will take a single example. In my country, in France, 42 billionaires earned 230 billion euros in a year, the equivalent of a check for € 3,400 for each Frenchman. At the same time, the shareholders received a jackpot of almost 100 billion euros in dividends last year. And on the other side, we have a third of Europeans who jump meals and people who die in the streets of our states. The equation is simple: we have a privileged minority in front of us who are gathered in Davos at the moment - I do not know if you will go, Madame von der Leyen - which are enriched on the back of all the others who s 'impoverish. However, your commission, as well as the right and the liberals of this Parliament systematically refused to seek money, this money where it is by blocking the margins of multinational companies that are enriched and by putting the billionaires who gave himself. Instead, you make people pay, people who are struggling, people by destroying public services, weakening labor law, demanding unjust reforms, pensions and unemployment benefits. What is all for? To satisfy your sacrosanct budgetary rules that bring back austerity. Because in reality, this is the real subject of which nobody speaks today and which should mobilize us all. I launch here the alert. We have before us the greatest cure of budgetary austerity ever seen on our continent. And it does not come from nowhere, Madame von der Leyen, she is your direct responsibility. Seriously, I have a question for you. You do not find that our crèches are not overloaded enough, that 30,000 beds removed from hospitals in my country, in France, since 2017, it is not enough that our hospitals are in very good health, that it does not miss Enough teachers already in our public schools, that our drugs and medical consultations are not already expensive enough, that electricity prices are not high enough and that it is necessary to remove public aid? And there, you said to yourself: with the zealous support of European states, Eurêka! Let's do worse! Let us ask the States to further sacrifice public services. I finish, Madam President, since the president of the group Renew - it is not even the president - Mr. Verhofstadt, had a little more time. I finish, I have for a short time, I promise you. In my country, France, the application of these new budgetary rules will mean cuts in public spending of 22 billion euros per year. So ok, it's only 12% of Bernard Arnault's fortune, but in real life, brought back to the state budget, that will mean the equivalent of the abolition of 623,000 teaching positions. Suffice to say a social massacre, to which you add a democratic scandal, dear colleagues, since a coalition of the social democrats and the liberals and the right together tries to go into force. Perhaps you were inspired by President Macron to import the 49.3 from France to Europe, well, I tell you, we will not let you do.",AGAINST,"Madam President, I strongly disagree with the notion that the European Commission is yielding to the whims of Hungary's president. The reality is that the Commission is working tirelessly to find a solution that benefits all member states, including Hungary. The opposition's proposal to increase European Union resources by taxing multinationals and billionaires is not a viable solution. It would lead to a decrease in investments, job losses, and a decline in economic growth. Instead, we should focus on implementing the budgetary rules that have been agreed upon, which will ensure fiscal discipline and stability in the EU. The proposed cuts in public spending are necessary to avoid a debt crisis and ensure the long-term sustainability of our public services. I urge my colleagues to support the Commission's proposal and reject the opposition's unrealistic and populist demands. We must prioritize fiscal responsibility and economic growth over ideology and short-term gains. The people of Europe deserve a stable and prosperous future, and we must work together to achieve it."
166175,"Dear Mr President, Ms. Commissioner Dalli, dear colleagues! I would like more realism in this debate We all want better air quality for our citizens, affordable mobility for citizens and companies and a competitive industry in the European Union in order to achieve progress in all areas and not to burden anyone about a fee at The Euro 7 standard a healthy middle ground. We have already developed this, this proposal is for voting here today. It improves air quality. Stricter limit values ​​will lead to EUR 70% less fine dust and trucks 60% less nitrogen oxides compared to Euro 6. Mobility remains affordable. Strict limit values ​​and new test procedures require considerable investments, but bring a comparatively low additional benefit for air quality. If we maintain the proven Euro 6 test procedures and only exacerbate the limit values, we prevent high investments in expensive technology that ultimately pays the consumer. We ensure the competitiveness of European industry. It was only at the beginning of this year that the combustion engine was decided in the EU from 2035. We cannot force the auto industry to invest billions in a run -out technology. Climate protection only works with industry, not against it. Air quality and the preservation of competitiveness and jobs in the EU have priority for us. This proposal brings the necessary balance. What is missing is a passage for technology neutrality. CO2-neutral fuels help climate protection. And with which means we achieve climate protection or better air in the end, cannot be prescribed. We need the competition. A ban on certain technology is never targeted. Politicians are not the better engineers. I didn't find any, even with the Greens, even though I was looking for a long time. For this reason, we have brought in changes so that the continued operation of combustion cars that are operated climate-neutral with CO2-neutral fuels is still possible after 2035. Dear colleagues, we found a good compromise. So my appeal to everyone here: Please support this balanced approach for better air, affordable mobility and globally competitive industry.",FOR,"Dear Mr President, Ms. Commissioner Dalli, dear colleagues! I strongly believe that the proposed Euro 7 standard does not go far enough in addressing the pressing issues of air quality and climate protection. While the proposal may bring some improvements, such as 70% less fine dust and 60% less nitrogen oxides, I firmly believe that these benefits are outweighed by the costs. The investments required to implement the new test procedures and stricter limit values are considerable, and I fear that these costs will be passed on to consumers, making mobility less affordable for our citizens. Furthermore, I disagree with the idea of maintaining the proven Euro 6 test procedures and only exacerbating the limit values. This approach may prevent high investments in expensive technology, but it also means that we are not pushing the industry to innovate and develop more sustainable solutions. Climate protection cannot be achieved without the industry, but it also cannot be achieved by allowing the industry to continue with business as usual. We need to be more ambitious and set stricter targets to drive innovation and reduce emissions. I also disagree with the proposal's focus on technology neutrality and the continued operation of combustion cars with CO2-neutral fuels. While I understand the appeal of this approach, I believe that it is a distraction from the real issue at hand. We need to focus on developing and promoting sustainable technologies, not finding ways to make unsustainable technologies more palatable. I urge my colleagues to reject this proposal and work towards a more ambitious and sustainable solution."
166175,"HR chairman! Every year, thousands of Europeans of poor air quality die from the transport sector we have just heard, and we also know from the World Health Organization It is the biggest threat to our health in the EU, so tackling air pollution is a common - or it should be one Common - Political Responsibility A Responsibility for City Council politicians and for national politicians and from us at European level But that responsibility has a majority here in this house refused to take on the agreement on Euro 7, we simply do not deliver on air pollution I think it is embarrassing that the European Parliament disclaims responsibility for the health of citizens, and it will actually be completely wrong to call the proposal we have here in the house, for euro 7 It is rather close to the existing euro 6 suggestions We of course need to Balancing the considerations between health and industry and competitiveness But the Commission had already ensured that there was a balance of and with the Agreement of the European Parliament, and we completely remove the balance that was from Renew to ID, then they have destroyed the balance sheet They have diluted the Commission's proposals together with the automotive industry they have reduced the ambitions of emissions, they have deteriorated the testing, and they have postponed the implementation for me it really is really a bad proposal that in no way helps citizens and ensures health. I think it's embarrassing and I and my group are going to vote against this proposal. We do not think it is ambitious, we did not think it is delivering on what it should deliver on, and therefore there is only one thing to say no thanks to that proposal, and I wish the Commission went too A little harder and dared to criticize the proposal that lies here today. For the Commission must also be quite disappointed to see their own proposal diluted as significantly as is the case.",AGAINST,"Honorable members of the European Parliament, I understand the concerns about air pollution, but I believe the proposal for Euro 7 is a step in the right direction. It is true that the Commission's original proposal has been diluted, but this is a result of a necessary balancing act between health, industry, and competitiveness. We must acknowledge that the automotive industry is a significant contributor to our economy, and we cannot ignore its concerns. The fact that the Commission's proposal has been adjusted to take into account the industry's needs is a sign of a healthy democracy. I agree that air pollution is a major threat to our health, but we must also consider the potential consequences of overly ambitious regulations on our economy and the livelihoods of our citizens. The proposal before us today is a compromise, and I believe it is a necessary one. I urge my fellow members to support this proposal and recognize that it is a step towards a more sustainable future, even if it is not perfect."
166175,"Mr. President, Mrs. curator, after long negotiations we will be able to vote a Coherent and Balanced Euro 7 standard that takes into account the health of citizens and improves air quality our proposal reduces Nox emissions 60% in trucks, 33% in cars and - for the first time - the contaminating particles of brakes and wheels, in addition to increasing the durability of the batteries. As I say, it is a sensible proposal, with realistic implementation times for the industry and, which is very important, without supplying more costs for consumers. Because I remember that what socialists and green ask here increases the price precisely from the lowest range vehicles and puts more sticks on the wheels to renew the vehicle park so old that it circulates along the roads in many European countries. Not only that: its proposal also puts the manufacture of smaller vehicles at risk - it existed those made in Europe - and, with it, thousands of jobs, for example, in Spain. Therefore, we ask them to support our proposal, which is good for the environment, good for citizens and also good for the competitiveness of Europe.",FOR,"Mr. President, Mrs. curator, while I understand the intentions behind the proposed Euro 7 standard, I strongly believe it does not go far enough in addressing the environmental concerns and health of our citizens. The proposed reduction of Nox emissions, although a step in the right direction, is not sufficient. Moreover, I am concerned that the realistic implementation times for the industry may be too lenient, allowing for continued pollution. I also disagree with the notion that increasing the environmental standards will necessarily increase costs for consumers, particularly for the lowest range vehicles. In fact, I believe that investing in cleaner technologies will lead to long-term savings and benefits for our citizens. Furthermore, I think it's a myth that stricter regulations will put the manufacture of smaller vehicles at risk and jeopardize jobs. On the contrary, I believe that embracing innovation and clean technologies will create new opportunities and safeguard the future of our industries. Therefore, I urge you to reject the current proposal and strive for more ambitious and effective measures to protect our environment and citizens."
166175,"– Mr President, sometimes you have the feeling that the Euro 7 debate was more about the car industry than it is about air quality, although this proposal is there to improve air quality – mainly in our cities, where road transport is still one of the biggest polluters in Europe, and where 70 000 people die prematurely because of bad air quality, because of road transport That’s what we’re trying to address here People are saying, of course, ‘we are trying here, we are moving to electric vehicles and that’s why we don’t need to do this.’ Well, the last standards that we are looking at now, Euro 6, they were formed in 2009, fifteen years ago, and the standards put in place in 2009 already could be met by technologies existing in 2009. What we are doing now is basically reinstalling Euro 6 standards and calling it Euro 7, but are not delivering any improvement on air quality, and at the same time claiming that our citizens will be improving. Is it needed when we are moving to electric? Well, be aware that any combustion engine that is still being sold until 2035 for cars will be on European roads until 2050. For trucks, we don’t even propose the end of the combustion engine, so they will be running on our streets even longer. Is it impossible? Even the Commission’s medium scenario showed the best cost-benefit ratio. The Commission already lowered their proposal, lowered the ambition in that proposal. We even further lower it. So anyone is saying that this is impossible to meet should read the impact assessment. Certainly the conservatives, who always love impact assessments. I think I have a final question to the Commission. If this is being adopted and indeed it is Euro 6, can you please hurry up the negotiations on the green claims, because this will be the best example of a greenwashing label.",FOR,"Mr President, while I understand the concerns about air quality, I must express my reservations about the Euro 7 proposal. The fact that we are moving towards electric vehicles means that the combustion engines will eventually be phased out. By 2035, cars with combustion engines will no longer be sold, and by 2050, they will be largely off our roads. Trucks may take longer, but the trend is clear. In the meantime, the cost-benefit ratio of implementing stricter emissions standards is not as clear-cut as some would claim. The Commission's own impact assessment showed that the best cost-benefit ratio was achieved with a more moderate approach, which is why they lowered their initial proposal. We should not rush into adopting a standard that may not be necessary in the long run. Instead, let us focus on supporting the transition to electric vehicles and ensuring that our green claims are accurate and trustworthy. Let us not create unnecessary burdens on our industries, but rather work towards a sustainable future through a more measured approach."
166175,"Mr President, Ms. Commissioner, values ​​colleagues! First of all: the commission proposal to the Euro 7 standards is completely unacceptable because you are not enough to abolish the auto industry in the EU from 2035? Do you want to advance the appointment to 2025? The proposal from the committee today for coordination is better, but not good. I am not concerned with individual content-a difficult undertaking in a ridiculous 90 seconds that are available to you-but that it is a scandal that we conservative, we conservatives from a minority left-green prosperity. , let the political arena grind through the political arena by ideological-political covers of our economy and our freedom on the nose ring. Should we agree with a mitigated, but still poor proposal to prevent even worse green ideological nonsense? So do we content ourselves with bad politics for the sake of compromise? We have not been chosen for that. In the reversal of the saying that is popular here, it should be better: ""."" We have to categorically show this dangerous green socialist utopist if we do not want to gamble our economic future-and that includes our auto industry.",AGAINST,"Mr President, Ms. Commissioner, values ​​colleagues!

The commission proposal, although not perfect, is a step in the right direction. I agree that the committee's proposal for coordination is better, but I think we should strive for even more ambitious goals.

Instead of rushing into new standards, we should focus on gradually improving our existing regulations, as proposed in this bill. It's a step in the right direction, and we should support it as a pragmatic solution to balance human life and economic growth."
166175,"Mr President, Ms. Commissioner, dear colleagues! Green prohibition policy is omnipresent: first the burner-in-off, then absurd restrictions on the driver's license including night driving ban for beginners, finally a law to restore nature that can paralyze our agriculture We are increasingly busy in this house, these consumer and industrial politics To correct, a policy of de -industrialization of Europe that lowers our prosperity and increases our dependence on other regions of world regions. This is not the case with global environmental protection. But contrary to the opinion of the Greens and Social Democrats, the protection of health, the protection of our European industry and the protection of jobs are not a contradiction - the negotiation result on Euro 7 is the best proof of this. The result is pragmatic and realistic, for three reasons: the air quality is sustainably improved by stricter limit values ​​for exhaust emissions of trucks and buses, through the first regulation of emissions from brake and tire abrasion- this is particularly important for electromobility- but also because older vehicles are replaced by the latest generation combustion engines. The industry remains competitive, the moderate adaptation of the limit values ​​creates the necessary planning security for industry. This is practical and is based on the economic feasibility. And third and last: individual mobility remains affordable. Strict limit values ​​and new test procedures would have made cars significantly more expensive, but only brought a little additional benefit for air quality. Especially in times of crisis such as these, cars must remain affordable for citizens. The voice of reason has won the Euro 7 negotiations. The result is a prime example of how environmental and industrial policy can go hand in hand when we leave green ideology outside. Therefore, I ask you to agree to this trilogy result tomorrow so that we can again shape politics with measure and middle, because clever environmental protection with industry - that works, but against industry - this will be difficult.",FOR,"Mr President, Ms. Commissioner, dear colleagues! I strongly disagree with the notion that the Euro 7 negotiation result is a victory for environmental and industrial policy going hand in hand. In reality, the moderate adaptation of limit values and the lack of strict test procedures will only lead to a minimal improvement in air quality. The fact that older vehicles will be replaced by the latest generation combustion engines is not enough, as it does not address the root cause of the problem. Furthermore, the emphasis on keeping cars affordable for citizens in times of crisis is a short-sighted approach that prioritizes economic feasibility over the health and well-being of our citizens. We should not compromise on the protection of our environment and public health for the sake of industrial competitiveness. I urge you to reconsider the Euro 7 proposal and strive for more ambitious and effective measures to reduce emissions and improve air quality."
166175,"HR chairman! Each year, more than 300,000 Europeans die as a result of air pollution. We could have made fewer demands on the automotive industry We have ended up with almost not to put someone to the ones I think it is incredibly unfortunate that we miss this opportunity to do something about what we do not take with the euro 7 standards the necessary showdown with Our air pollution, and I fear that because we are not delivering here in the house, we end up putting the demands on our mayors in the larger cities in Europe It will simply be so in the future that it will be difficult to be allowed to drive into a large city with a gasoline or diesel car because we have not tightened the rules sufficiently then they will shut off it, and then we actually have problems with the free movement we could have solved this, but We chose not to do what I think we're going to see lots of environmental zones in the future, which then makes you try locally in the cities, after all, try to do something I am disappointed in this house, but I am also disappointed Over the Commission The Commission chose not to fight for its own good proposal they did not take up the fight they just accepted that the automotive industry ended up thinking that this would be so terrible I am deeply disappointed that the Commission did not assume its responsibility I am coming To vote no to the agreement because I would like to support the health of EU citizens we do not do with this legislation",AGAINST,"Honorable chairman, I understand the concerns about air pollution, but I believe the Euro 7 standards are a step in the right direction. By not tightening the rules too much, we are giving the automotive industry a chance to adapt and innovate. If we had made the demands too strict, it would have led to a significant increase in costs, which would have been passed on to consumers. This would have resulted in fewer people being able to afford cleaner cars, ultimately hindering our progress towards a more sustainable future. Moreover, by not overregulating, we are avoiding the creation of numerous environmental zones in cities, which would have restricted the free movement of people and goods. I commend the Commission for finding a balance between environmental concerns and economic realities. I will vote in favor of the agreement because I believe it strikes the right balance and supports the well-being of EU citizens in a responsible manner."
166175,"Mr. President, Mrs. curator, after long negotiations, finally, we will approve today a Euro 7 standard with which we must all be very satisfied a sensible proposal with realistic implementation times and that improves air quality. Fine particles are regulated for the first time - the most harmful to health - and also brakes and wheels and battery durability. And this without supplying more costs for citizens or unnecessary extra investments; Without supposing the end of small cars and without an impediment to European competitiveness, which is at stake, as we have seen last week, for China's unfair competition. Therefore, we ask them to support this proposal because the European Union cannot turn their backs to citizens who need to replace their old and polluting cars with others clean and affordable. The European Union cannot put more sticks on the wheels to a sector that needs to transform very fast, invest in technology and win the electrification career. Today health, economy, jobs and strategic autonomy are at stake.",FOR,"Mr. President, Mrs. curator, while the Euro 7 standard aims to improve air quality, we must consider the potential implications on European competitiveness. As we've seen last week, China's unfair competition is already a threat. By implementing this standard, we risk adding unnecessary extra investments and costs for citizens, which could ultimately lead to the end of small cars. We must prioritize the sector's ability to transform and invest in technology without being hindered by overregulation. Let us not forget that the European Union's strategic autonomy is also at stake. Therefore, I urge you to reconsider this proposal and ensure that we do not inadvertently harm the very sector we are trying to support."
166175,"– Mr President, colleagues, Commission, thank you, we are standing here for a pretty disappointing deal, to be very honest We all know that the most effective way of dealing with pollution is source policies – making sure that at the source, we are reducing it, and we are hardly doing that in this deal First of all, and this is a question to the Commission on the cars, or the light duty vehicles: it is the same as Euro 6. So can you not just now already say that you are not going to use Euro 7and just call it what it is? It’s Euro 6. If not, then probably we need your green claims proposal because it will be greenwashing by pretending that we are cleaning up the cars more, although they are not. So let me be very clear on that. But secondly, by failing at the European level with these very efficient source policies, we are pushing all the responsibilities to local communities and to local governments. In the cities, they will be forced to act on it, because it is the people that are breathing bad air in those cities and it is partly because of road transport. And this means that we are now pushing the responsibility to the local governments to put in ‘Umwelt zones’ and all that. And then, of course, the same politicians here agreeing with this will start complaining about it. But that is the result of complacency here, we are pushing the responsibility to there where they can hardly act. And that is a failure of this proposal. So the Greens will vote against it.",AGAINST,"Mr. President, colleagues, Commission, I understand the concerns raised about the Euro 7 proposal, but I would like to offer a different perspective. While it is true that the emissions standards for light duty vehicles are similar to Euro 6, this does not necessarily mean it's greenwashing. By adopting Euro 7, we are at least maintaining the current level of emissions reduction and paving the way for future improvements. Moreover, the proposal acknowledges the need for source policies and encourages local communities to take action. The introduction of 'Umwelt zones' in cities can be seen as a positive step towards reducing pollution, as it empowers local governments to take responsibility for their citizens' health. Rather than pushing responsibilities, we are promoting a collaborative approach to tackling pollution. I urge you to consider the benefits of this proposal and the potential for future growth and improvement."
166175,"Mr. Chairman! The climate ambitions of the European Union have their own specific price, and it is quite high, which will ultimately not be paid by commission officials or climate activists, but entrepreneurs and citizens of transport are one of the most important sectors of the economy not only creates jobs and generates profits, but protects the deliveries for industry and Trade for Poland is one of the key services sector industries. New emission standards for trucks and delivery vehicles are above all a cost that can be deadly for small and medium -sized companies forced to replace the fleet, older vehicles in accordance with the Euro 6 standard will certainly be charged with additional fees And pushed out of roads and cities, this also applies to passenger cars, the effectiveness of this type of regulations itself is also doubtful, which the dieselgate scandal proved and what we see from the other hand in the atmosphere in which the desired changes of course do not occur. Today we know that there are huge costs behind the facade of the green order. Economic crisis and Europe's addiction to products from ... (",AGAINST,"Mr. Chairman, I strongly believe that the Type-approval of motor vehicles and engines with respect to their emissions and battery durability, also known as Euro 7, is a necessary step towards achieving the European Union's climate ambitions. While it is true that new emission standards may pose a cost to entrepreneurs and citizens, we must not forget that the cost of inaction far outweighs the cost of transitioning to cleaner vehicles. The dieselgate scandal has shown us that the current regulations are not effective, and it is our duty to ensure that such scandals do not happen again. Furthermore, the effectiveness of regulations is not doubtful, but rather, it is the lack of enforcement that is the problem. By implementing Euro 7, we can create a level playing field for all companies, big and small, and encourage innovation and investment in cleaner technologies. I urge you to support this proposal and take a step towards a greener and more sustainable future for Europe."
166175,"Mr. President! It is gratifying that again the Euro 7 standard could form over the group, which instead of green ideology and visions could at least partially maintain measure and middle for the auto industry and are ultimately also consumer-friendly, because it would be the cars in particular In the low price segment, which would have experienced a massive increase in a massive exposure with the original EU commission draft and that we were able to prevail with the stricter requirements for the durability of drive batteries, is also a success, and we are the goal of the regulatory preference of E -TASTOS to end, also a little closer. We reject mandatory on -board surveillance systems and stricter limit values ​​for trucks and buses, but of course it is a fact that it is basically not really about reducing pollutant emissions, because in the past 30 years they have decreased by 70% in nitrogen oxides, Although the approved vehicles have doubled. The aim of implementing the so -called mobility turnaround of the Green Deal was always an accelerated end of the internal combustion engine. Therefore, with this coordination, the fact that with the consent to this Euro 7 compromise, the completely realistic limit values ​​of the EU Commission are off the table, and we will agree to this proposal.",FOR,"Mr. President! While some may view the Euro 7 standard as a success, I strongly disagree. The fact that pollutant emissions have decreased by 70% in nitrogen oxides over the past 30 years is commendable, but it is not a reason to become complacent. The original EU commission draft was ambitious, and it is disappointing that we had to settle for a compromise that may not be as effective in reducing emissions. Furthermore, the stricter requirements for the durability of drive batteries, while a step in the right direction, do not go far enough. I reject the notion that mandatory on-board surveillance systems and stricter limit values for trucks and buses are unnecessary. Instead, I believe they are crucial in achieving our goal of reducing pollutant emissions and implementing the mobility turnaround of the Green Deal. We should not be satisfied with the status quo and should strive for more ambitious targets. Therefore, I urge my fellow parliamentarians to reconsider this proposal and aim for a more comprehensive and effective approach to reducing emissions."

Buses and trucks are currently responsible for 6% of emissions in the EU, and we are all dependent on their services in our daily life - simply do without the trip to work or for full shelves in the supermarket, this is out of the question and only together If we manage to reduce the emissions of the industry, all options must be on the table instead of enabling this, Greens and Social Democrats prefer to drive their idea of ​​prohibition. Because again CO2-neutral fuels should play no role, again there should be artificial restrictions on electrical and hydrogen. Again no openness to all technologies, prefer to ban, dear Bas Eickhout. And you can do that better - you have already shown that on the car - that's your policy. But with us - the many jobs, the small and medium -sized manufacturers of trucks and trailers seem to be completely irrelevant - manufacturers that are deeply anchored in their regions and offer well -paid jobs. Now unrealistic targets - and frankly, also threaten ruinous penalty payments. This is politics against our industry and also against our middle class, in the end politics against people - we must not accept that. Today's coordination is the last way to leave the wrong way of technology in this legislature. And Bas Eickhout said: We shouldn't talk about the topic of e-fuel. So, dear Bas Eickhout, there are three options from EVP today: We have a broad definition of CO2-neutral fuels, we have a factor with a lid, and we only have an application for e-fuel. And I can say for the EPP: If we finally move this parliament in the right direction today and one of these applications is approved, then the EVP is also on board, and then we can make the mistakes we have made in the past, correct. We are ready as EVP, I hope the Greens too.",AGAINST,"Mr President, Commissioner Hoekstra, dear colleagues! I strongly disagree with the notion that we should hinder the transition to cleaner heavy-duty vehicles. The fact that buses and trucks are responsible for 6% of emissions in the EU is a stark reminder of the urgent need for action. By setting unrealistic targets, we are not threatening the industry, but rather pushing it to innovate and adapt to the changing times. The Greens and Social Democrats are not proposing a blanket ban, but rather a phased approach that allows for the development of alternative technologies, such as electrical and hydrogen. It's time to put the people and the planet above the interests of the industry. We should not be swayed by the argument that this will harm small and medium-sized manufacturers, as they will have ample opportunity to adapt and thrive in a low-carbon economy. Let us seize this opportunity to correct the mistakes of the past and set a clear direction for a sustainable future.

We are busy insanely busy the temperature of the globe is rising, and Europe's role as world leader in green technology is in danger We have actually long been in the global driver's jersey when it comes to climate policy and industrial policy If we get today's vote well, then we have one Opportunity to continue to continue to show the way to reduce our CO2 emissions and continue to show the way for an innovative industry that can develop the green buses and trucks of the future Today, buses and trucks emerge over 6 % of the EU's total greenhouse gases and it will rise if we do nothing. Therefore, it is crucial that our industry be able to develop the world's best zero emission buses and trucks. And with the negotiating result on heavy vehicles, we secure exactly that. We set ambitious demands on the industry and ensure high reduction targets. For 2030, all new city buses will be zero-emissions buses, and by 2040, new trucks that are being sold will have to emit 90 % less CO2 overall. These are crucial signals. Long -term signals that we send today. These are clear signals for our industry so they can plan for that. These are clear signals that will help to secure them a global leadership position, because in the future, electric buses and zero emission trucks will be the cheapest and not least the greenest. The question is not about, but rather when? And I think we're in a hurry! What has happened to our solar cell industry should not also happen to our truck industry. We cannot allow it to happen, and therefore we have to have legislation that makes demands on the market - we cannot leave it to the market myself - but that is why I am also incredibly proud of the deal we have made .

While we acknowledge Europe's role as a world leader in green technology, we must also consider the potential risks of over-regulation. If we set overly ambitious targets, we risk losing our competitive edge in the truck industry, just like what happened to our solar cell industry. The proposed targets of 90% less CO2 emissions for new trucks by 2040 may be too stringent, and may lead to unintended consequences such as job losses and increased costs for consumers. We should not rush into legislation that makes demands on the market without considering the potential impact on our industry. Instead, we should allow the market to drive innovation and transition to green technology at a more sustainable pace. We should not be in a hurry to sacrifice our industry's competitiveness for the sake of being in the 'green driver's jersey'.

166887,"Mr. President, Dear colleagues, Mr. Commissioner, I wanted to recall that we are a few days before COP 28 and that this text is absolutely fundamental for trucks and buses, since we are going to decarbonize all of the road transport in Europe , after having done it for cars and vans is therefore a structuring text for the next 20 to 30 years our responsibility, it is to be both ambitious and pragmatic. Ambitious, that means that we should not give in to the objectives and that is why the Renew group will support the initial proposal of the Commission. We are even ready to go a little further, a little faster, to go as much as possible in the decarbonation of road transport. Regarding buses, we also want 100% of new buses that will be sold in cities are zero emissions in 2030. But we are pragmatic on school cars for example, for which technology is less mature and therefore we leave more time for school cars to adapt. And we make sure that the local cities and communities that have invested in biomethane buses can see their investments protected over time. And then there is the question of road transport concerning the specific technology of e-carigants. The vast majority of the Renew group will oppose amendments that want to disrupt this text. As the Commissioner, which is nevertheless part of the PPE group, recalled, as all the truck manufacturers recall, we do not need e-fuels in this text because, precisely, we need e-carigants elsewhere , to decarbonize the airline and the maritime sector.",FOR,"Mr. President, Dear colleagues, Mr. Commissioner, as we approach COP 28, we must acknowledge the significance of this proposal. However, we must also be cautious not to overstep our bounds. The initial proposal of the Commission, although ambitious, may be too hasty. We should prioritize pragmatism and consider the technological limitations of certain sectors, such as school cars, where biomethane buses have already been invested in. Disrupting these investments would be counterproductive. Moreover, e-fuels could play a crucial role in decarbonizing road transport, and we should not dismiss their potential outright. The Commissioner and truck manufacturers may argue that e-carigants are needed elsewhere, but we must consider the bigger picture and the potential benefits of e-fuels in this sector. We should not rush into decisions that may have unintended consequences. Therefore, I propose that we take a more measured approach and consider amendments that would allow for a more gradual transition."

Commission members The Climate Crisis is urgent in parts of the transition, it is moving forward, but when it comes to emissions from heavy transport, emissions still increase despite the Paris Agreement, despite a European Climate Act, emissions are still increasing in terms of heavy transport. Therefore, it is extremely important that we make ambitious decisions that ensure that the manufacturers of heavy trucks must reduce their emissions and focus on electrification. Because that is what is the future of heavy transport. But I am concerned that the European right is trying to undermine these decisions and reduce ambitions. It would be very unfortunate, because we already have enough rolling trucks on our streets that emit carbon dioxide and we have to reduce them extremely quickly.",FOR,"Mr. President!

Let us prioritize a balanced approach that takes into account the complexities of the transition to electrification and avoids putting European industries at a disadvantage."
166887,"– Mr President, we are all in agreement with our good friend Bas Eickhout – but he's not listening – regarding the need to reduce CO2 emissions on the heavy vehicles But our approach is a pragmatic one, meaning that before we have very ambitious goals and then we do not reach them, we prefer to have very pragmatic goals that we make sure that all the Member States will reach There are three points in which the ECR Group will be fighting on. Number one is the carbon correction factor, which we think is necessary to handle the wide variety of heavy vehicles. Number two is the urban buses. We ran a study in Italy and in most of the largest cities, we reach the goal that is proposed in the text, but most of the smaller cities will not make it because of a whole bunch of different problems, especially on the recharging stations and so on.  And last, neutral fuels. We know Germany – and we hear Peter Liese – they are very strong on synthetic fuels. Italy is very strong on biomasses. We do believe that we need to accept all the different type of less impacting fuels.",AGAINST,"– Mr President, I disagree with the pragmatic approach taken by the ECR Group. In fact, I believe we should be more ambitious in our goals to reduce CO2 emissions from heavy vehicles. As Bas Eickhout has pointed out, the need to reduce emissions is pressing. We should not settle for 'pragmatic goals' that may not be enough to meet the challenge. Instead, we should aim high and work together to ensure that all Member States can reach these targets. The study in Italy, for example, shows that the largest cities can already meet the proposed goals, and with some effort, smaller cities can also adapt. Furthermore, by focusing on electric vehicles, we can create a unified standard across the EU, rather than accepting a variety of 'less impacting fuels' that may not be as effective in reducing emissions. Let us strive for a more ambitious and unified approach to reducing CO2 emissions from heavy vehicles."
166887,"Mr. President, honorable colleagues, the green transition must not be an economically and socially unsustainable boulder after cars, you have decided to impose the electric also for heavy vehicles: you have decided to sink companies and entire supply chains. For what? Well, not for the climate. You said no to biofuels, renewable fuels. We have proposed them. It is therefore clear that industrial policies are hidden behind environmental policies. Oh yes, because then to benefit it will be only China. There will be consequences on companies and entire supply chains. The transport sector, a sector already in difficulty for the economic crisis and the costs of fuels, will be on its knees. There was no impact analysis. There are no valid alternatives for such long sections. And then, for the municipalities, you decided to impose 100% electric for 2030 for public transport. So I wonder, especially the small municipalities, where do you think they can take the money? An electrical bus costs on average five times more. You are putting the future of companies, workers and municipalities at risk only for an ideology.",AGAINST,"Mr. President, honorable colleagues, I strongly believe that strengthening the CO2 emission performance targets for new heavy-duty vehicles is a necessary step towards a greener future. We cannot ignore the fact that the transport sector is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. By imposing stricter targets, we are actually helping companies and entire supply chains to innovate and adapt to the changing times. The fact that China will benefit is not a valid reason to block this proposal, but rather a reason to lead by example and show the world that we are committed to reducing our carbon footprint. While it is true that electric buses are more expensive, the long-term benefits to the environment and public health far outweigh the costs. Furthermore, this proposal will create new opportunities for investment and job creation in the renewable energy sector. We owe it to ourselves, our children, and future generations to take bold action against climate change. Let us not be held back by short-sighted economic interests and ideological opposition. We must seize this opportunity to create a sustainable future for all."

Of course, there are reasons that can be explained: the increase in demand from many areas of the world after Covid, the reduction of Russian gas. All concrete reasons. But there was more and we cannot deny it. There have certainly been market manipulation actions, if not real financial speculations, and the message that derived from it was very clear: we must intervene and intervene well because this does not happen. The aim is therefore to create more stringent, more effective surveillance rules. And I insisted, together with the rapporteur and other colleagues, so that a leap forward was truly accomplished, so that this reform was not so formal. We do not want - as liberalists fear - manipulating the market, locking it, prevent them from working. We want it to work well to guarantee citizens and businesses, so that the market is not damage but both the place where everything can happen clearly and transparency. We also insisted on putting some transparency rule to non -European operators, because even those must respond to our logic and our criterion of proper functioning.",FOR,"President, Commissioner, Honourable Colleagues, while I understand the concerns regarding market manipulation in the wholesale energy market, I strongly believe that this reform may not be the solution we are looking for. We must not forget that the increases in prices in 2021 and 2022 were also due to concrete reasons such as the increase in demand and the reduction of Russian gas. By introducing more stringent surveillance rules, we risk manipulating the market and preventing it from working freely. As liberals, we fear that this reform may lock the market and prevent it from adapting to changing circumstances. Furthermore, imposing transparency rules on non-European operators may be seen as an overreach of our authority and may not be effective in preventing market manipulation. We must be cautious not to damage the market, but rather allow it to function clearly and transparently without undue interference."

It is a victory for both us in the European Parliament, which has brought with us the Commission and the Council on more progressive legislation, and for Europe's consumers, who will now receive better protection. We increase transparency, we increase transparency and we ensure that the European authority has the opportunity to conduct its own investigations at the occasions when national authorities do not act. Europe's citizens should be able to trust that the price they pay in the electricity bill is the actual price and that there has been no manipulation, neither by European companies nor by foreign power, which risks being able to use the electricity market as a weapon. We are now stopping this, and it is very good.",FOR,"Mrs. Speaker, while I understand the desire to protect consumers from market manipulation, I fear this legislation may be an overreach. We already have national authorities in place to monitor and regulate the electricity market. By giving the European authority the power to conduct its own investigations, we risk duplicating efforts and creating unnecessary bureaucracy. Furthermore, increased transparency, while well-intentioned, may not necessarily lead to lower electricity costs for consumers. We must be cautious not to stifle competition and innovation in the market, which could ultimately harm the very consumers we are trying to protect. Let us not forget that foreign powers may still find ways to manipulate the market, and this legislation may not be the silver bullet we think it is."

The focus of politics should be on creating prospects for citizens, that as many people as possible have a job and a stable income, that economic growth is possible and that people have the opportunity to own their own housing. It requires an energy policy that is rational and which is based on market economy and not today's planning economy that the EU is doing.",AGAINST,"Mrs. Speaker! I disagree with the notion that our climate policy has been ineffective. While it is true that the rest of the world does not follow our path, we must lead by example and show that a rational energy policy based on a market economy can coexist with a strong climate agenda. In fact, our focus on renewable energy has created jobs and stimulated economic growth in the sustainable sector. Furthermore, a planning economy in the energy sector allows us to ensure that our policies have a significant impact on reducing carbon emissions, which is essential for the future of our planet. We should continue to prioritize a climate policy that balances economic growth with environmental protection."

Directive DRIVING License from the Transport Committee was adopted in only one voice of twenty -two MEPs voted for, twenty -one against it shows how much controversy it arouses that we as representatives of the residents of Europe in the European Parliament should create such solutions that facilitate, simplify and limit the load bureaucratic, which are a reaction to the needs, challenges and possibilities that eliminate existing barriers and increase safety and this is what I was guided by working on this directive, I am glad that during the work in the transport committee we managed to reject many controversial corrections or regulations, and accept these, which are expected in Europe, such as the introduction of a digital driving license or the concept of temporary driving license that will allow European Union citizens to obtain a certificate that will be valid throughout Europe, which confirms the right to drive a vehicle in the event of loss or theft of a driving license. Unfortunately, as a PPE group, we cannot agree with compulsory medical tests, especially if they are based only on the age criterion, and not on objective health conditions as the only form of verification of the ability to drive. We strongly support the recognition of existing various domestic systems, often more economical and effective. We also cannot agree to the introduction of the EU penalty points system. This is contrary to the treaties, with the principle of subsidiarity. As PPE, we support proposals that make it easier for young people to enter the labor market as a driver, of course, met with strict conditions. Ladies and Gentlemen! I believe that in votes we will reject unacceptable social corrections, and we will accept those whose goal is to improve safety, digest, increase the number of drivers and facilitating especially for young drivers. In conclusion, I would like to thank everyone for their cooperation and I am counting on a good vote, because the inhabitants of Europe are waiting for it, and I would not like to be discouraged by our decisions of many of our voters, because thus we open the door for those who are opposed to the community European.",FOR,"Mrs. President! Mrs. Commissioner! Ladies and Gentlemen! I stand before you today to express my opposition to the proposed Directive on Driving Licenses. While I understand the intention to simplify and limit bureaucratic burdens, I strongly believe that certain aspects of this directive go too far. The introduction of a digital driving license and the concept of a temporary driving license, while seemingly convenient, pose significant risks to safety and security. Furthermore, the recognition of existing domestic systems for medical tests is not only more economical but also more effective in ensuring that drivers are fit to be on the road. I also agree that the EU penalty points system is a necessary measure to ensure road safety, and it is not contrary to the principle of subsidiarity. In fact, it is a crucial step towards creating a unified and safe driving environment across the European Union. I urge you to reject the proposals that would make it easier for young people to enter the labor market as drivers without strict conditions, as this would compromise road safety. Let us prioritize the safety and well-being of our citizens over bureaucratic convenience. I urge you to vote against this directive in its current form."
165088,"Mrs. President, Honorable Colleagues, the Report on the revision of the Directive on driving licenses aims to harmonize the requirements for the driving license at the EU, with some news, such as the measures for novice drivers or the new digital license we know well that The most discussion point is that of mandatory medical checks: I consider it one of the fundamental points to guarantee a high level of road safety. In this way, in fact, the physical integrity of a driver is objectively assessed by a qualified professional. I know that in some Member States this does not happen and the medical examination is replaced with self -certification. However, I think that, as legislators, we must always keep the precautionary principle stop and guarantee the highest levels of safety. For example, I think of the control of vision, which is an essential element for a driver, whose loss of diopters is difficult to find with a personal evaluation. For this reason I hope that tomorrow the plenary confirm the position of the Transport Commission and gives a clear signal, I would like to say historian, in favor of greater road safety.",FOR,"Mrs. President, Honorable Colleagues, while I understand the desire to harmonize the requirements for driving licenses at the EU level, I have to express my concerns about the mandatory medical checks proposed in the Report. In some Member States, self-certification has been sufficient, and I believe we should respect the diversity of approaches among our countries. Moreover, I worry that mandatory medical checks could be an unnecessary burden on citizens, particularly for those with no history of medical issues. For instance, the control of vision can be done through personal evaluation, and the loss of diopters can be self-monitored. I urge the plenary to reconsider the Transport Commission's position and prioritize a more flexible approach that balances road safety with individual freedom and responsibility."
165088,"Madam President, my dear colleagues, the European Parliament will rule tomorrow on a major text for strengthening road safety in Europe, namely the revision of the Driving Directive This text contains a controversial but necessary measure On which I will extend, it is the establishment of a compulsory medical examination every fifteen years during the administrative renewal of this permit, in order to judge the physical and mental aptitudes of the drivers This systematization of the medical examination, already Established in a number of Member States, is not intended to penalize drivers, but to protect all users of public space. And it is not as such an attack on the driving license. How can we justify that our vehicles can be subject to regular, compulsory and rhythmic technical controls when drivers are never verified? It is, not to attack mobility, but to ensure secure mobility, as was the case with the seat belt, which has been the subject of the same debates as the medical examination 40 years ago, and that nobody would now think of questioning. To those who castigate that Europe intervenes about a driver's license which concerns a whole European space of freedom to circulate, I answer that there is on the contrary an urgent need to harmonize. Finally, I would say that, as legislators, we have the possibility of improving the safety of all users of the public road. We will therefore be accountable by our vote of all the lives which will be won or spoiled or lost.",FOR,"Madam President, my dear colleagues, I understand the intention behind the proposed revision of the Driving Directive, but I strongly believe that the establishment of a compulsory medical examination every fifteen years is an unnecessary measure that will penalize drivers and attack their mobility. We must remember that our vehicles are subject to technical controls, but they do not have the same impact on our daily lives as a medical examination would have. Furthermore, the harmonization of driving licenses across the EU is not a valid argument for this measure, as it would be an overreach of European authority into a matter that concerns individual member states. We must not forget that the freedom to circulate is a fundamental right in the European space. As legislators, we have a responsibility to protect this right and not impose unnecessary burdens on our citizens. Let us not repeat the mistakes of the past, but rather learn from them and find alternative solutions that do not compromise the mobility of our citizens."
165088,"Mrs. President, ladies and gentlemen, dear Karima! Europe is growing together, and we make the European driver's license future -oriented. Our vision is of course zero traffic fatalities in Europe by 2050 In order to increase safety on our streets, we have looked at the best experiences of the member states and now make it partly in Europe Germany, for example, supports accompanied driving, which I was currently able to practice with my children, highly helped us to see better driving for beginners. The health checks known from Spain and just mentioned in the administrative extension of the driver's license also contribute to increased security. We are in favor of this driving suitability should now be checked every 15 years. We look forward to this EU-wide digital driver's license. One thing is clear: many details are still left to the countries, but we are looking forward to the negotiations in the trilogue. We have to keep our goal in connection with the ""Vision Null"" for 2050. It's about security on the street and fewer dead in the future.",FOR,"Mrs. President, ladies and gentlemen, while I understand the vision of a future-oriented European driver's license, I have to express my concerns about the current proposal. The implementation of accompanied driving, as practiced in Germany, and the health checks from Spain, are steps in the right direction, but we must not rush into a one-size-fits-all approach. The EU-wide digital driver's license, although a good idea, still leaves many details to the countries, which could lead to confusion and inconsistencies. Furthermore, the proposal to check driving suitability every 15 years might not be enough to achieve our goal of zero traffic fatalities by 2050. I urge caution and careful consideration in the trilogue negotiations to ensure that our goal of increased security on the streets is not compromised by hasty decisions."
165088,"Mrs. Speaker! As a former truck driver and member of the European Parliament, I am extremely proud to be able to share my experiences and improve the EU transport sector in 2018, I led the previous driver's license, with innovations in training and practical measures such as increasing the B-driver's license to 4 250 kilos for electrical vehicles, teaching of snow chains and the establishment of an EU register to detect false driving licenses These efforts have led to a significant reduction in traffic deaths in the EU It is a performance that we can be proud of in the beginning I had serious concerns about this revision of the directive, led by the Greens, when the proposals were only aimed at frontal attack SUVs and young drivers. A specific SUV driver's license and a maximum speed of 90 kilometers per hour for new drivers were proposed. Fortunately, we managed to maintain focus on road safety during the negotiations. This is a wonderful result that also shows how valuable practical experience is in the political decision -making process.",FOR,"Mrs. Speaker! I strongly disagree with the latest revision of the driving licence directive. Although I acknowledge the efforts made in 2018, which led to a reduction in traffic deaths, I believe the current proposals do not go far enough. The initial proposals, led by the Greens, aimed at introducing a specific SUV driver's license and a maximum speed of 90 kilometers per hour for new drivers, were steps in the right direction. Unfortunately, these measures were not maintained during the negotiations. I fear that the current directive is too focused on compromise rather than road safety. We should have taken a bolder approach to address the dangers posed by SUVs and young drivers. I urge my fellow members to reconsider and prioritize road safety above all else."
165088,"Madam president, lady commissioner, ladies colleagues, we have probably reached a period of the legislature that is not the most suitable for discussing these issues, because there are exploitation, the groups are divided, my group is divided and probably my position It is not that of so many colleagues but the issue of security is important, the rapporteur said it: who of us speaks with the association of family members of the victims of the road knows this emergency well the directive, of course, but an update of These rules was necessary and the level of harmonization that was achieved at the end of intense parliamentary works, in my opinion, is the right one, because we still have the opportunity to improve this text on training, which has an important role. There are amendments on this and first aid. We have already inserted further facilitation to have access to the license for driving heavy vehicles, which is an important and urgent theme. And then on the physical suitability of drivers, we must overcome this idea that driving ability can be self -certified, because unfortunately reality is very different, especially when this theme is linked to health and age -related problems. On the accompanied guide we took the experience of some Member States that had very positive advanced points and on night guide there were no limits that would have affected the world of rurality. Non -hazardous driving behaviors, therefore also with the assumption of substances, are confirmed with zero tolerance. Here, I believe that, beyond what has been discussed perhaps even in the newspapers in recent weeks, if you go to see the text is a good and positive text and that it must all see us engaged on the issue of safety.",FOR,"Madam president, lady commissioner, ladies colleagues, while I understand the importance of security, I must express my reservations about the current proposal on driving licences. As the rapporteur mentioned, the issue of security is crucial, but I fear that the level of harmonization achieved may not be suitable for all member states. Furthermore, the idea of overcoming self-certification of driving ability may be too restrictive, especially for rural areas where access to medical facilities may be limited. Additionally, the zero-tolerance policy on non-hazardous driving behaviors may be too harsh and not take into account the specific circumstances of each case. I believe we should reconsider the text and take a more nuanced approach to these issues, rather than rushing to adopt a proposal that may have unintended consequences."

Children driving buses full of people, women, babies, older elements from countries where the minimum age is set at 18 years clearly show that young truck drivers are much more likely to cause traffic accidents and accidents. We have a responsibility to legislate to reduce the deaths and very serious injuries that occur daily on the streets of the European Union. So how can we allow driving licenses without any medical opinion, not even a vision examination? Do not more frequent re -checks to confirm driving ability from a particular age onwards, and especially when there are serious underlying diseases? How can we allow driving licenses for motorbikes without any practical training? I am afraid that this is how we cannot serve the vision of the European Union, Vision Zero, for zero traffic deaths by 2050. Dear colleagues, once again I invite you to vote in favor of my amendments, to reject these proposals that serve interests and interests They make our ways more dangerous. I invite you to vote to save human lives.",AGAINST,"Madam President, Lady Commissioner, I understand the concerns about road safety, but I must emphasize that the current proposal does not intend to lower the minimum age for driving trucks or buses in countries where it is currently set at 18 years. It is essential to note that some countries already allow 17-year-olds to drive certain vehicles, and we must respect the diversity of our member states' regulations. Furthermore, the proposal does not abolish medical opinions or vision examinations for driving licenses; it is up to the member states to decide on the frequency of re-checks. As for motorbikes, practical training is not the only factor that determines a rider's ability. We should not dismiss the potential benefits of this proposal, such as increased mobility and job opportunities for young people. Let us not forget that our goal is to achieve Vision Zero by 2050, and this proposal is a step towards harmonizing our regulations and improving road safety across the EU. I invite you to vote in favor of the proposal and work together to create a safer and more efficient transportation system."

This says how it was possible, and allow it to say that, of course, with the work of all, otherwise there would not have been this unanimity, without false modesty, with my contribution, my political group, PPE, we were able to reconcile these points Of different sight, for example in the particular case of wine, which had so much discussion. And here, referring to the work that my political group did, which I did as a rapporteur myself, obviously I can't forget the work that all my colleagues did and, naturally, in the person of the rapporteur, ours Colleague Paolo de Castro, who also knew how to perceive and welcome many of the points of view we had. It's a good example - and I hope the European Commission will be particularly attentive - how it is possible to produce legislation that reconciles the various interests in presence. The unanimous vote we had in the agriculture commission is a good lesson of how in politics it is always more important to defend the interests of public policy recipients than only and exclusively ideology. Regarding wine: Obviously, if there are different points of view, we have achieved that, in fact, the specificity of such an important product for the agricultural economy, and so important to several Member States, remained in common agricultural policy in its substantial part . And it is, therefore, with great satisfaction that I see this position of the Agriculture Commission and that I hope that in the votes of tomorrow we can maintain it.",FOR,"President, colleagues, I stand before you today to express my concerns regarding the proposal of regulation on Geographical Indications for wine, spirit drinks and agricultural products. While I acknowledge the efforts made by the rapporteur and the agriculture commission to reconcile different interests, I fear that this proposal may not fully address the specificities and legitimate interests of all Member States. The fact that the agriculture commission voted unanimously does not necessarily mean that this proposal is in the best interest of public policy recipients. In fact, I believe that this proposal may prioritize the interests of certain groups over others, particularly in the case of wine. I urge you to consider the potential consequences of this proposal and to ensure that the interests of all Member States are equally represented.

164532,"Madam President, Mr. Commissioner, dear Paolo, I want to congratulate our colleague, Paolo de Castro, for the work he has done, as well as alternative speakers I think a great job has been done is true that it is a very important regulation. Here most of the regulations regarding geographical indications are unified - not all, there is a part of the wine that remains in the unique OCM. But I believe that the agreement is good, above all, because we are reinforcing a system that not only intends to strengthen a brand, it is not a commercial brand, we all know it: it is culture, tradition, heritage, rural areas, our peoples. This is what this regulation means; It is very, very important. Therefore, I feel proud of the work that has been done by everyone. I know that the commissioner has said that he did not like the place of the USA. We consider that the US can help, but not have a main role. That role has to correspond to the agri DG. That is the opinion of this Parliament and I believe that we must congratulate us all. And finally, I want to add that we have not only reinforced the system: this is the basis of the system and the basis of rural areas. Therefore, let's continue supporting these geographical indications that are clearly a brand of European quality.",FOR,"Madam President, Mr. Commissioner, I must express my reservations regarding the proposed regulation on Geographical Indications for wine, spirit drinks, and agricultural products. While I acknowledge the efforts made by our colleague Paolo de Castro, I believe that unifying most of the regulations regarding geographical indications may not be the best approach. The unique OCM for wine, for instance, has its merits and should not be dismissed so readily. Furthermore, I think it is premature to assume that the US can only play a secondary role in this matter. Perhaps we should consider giving them a more prominent role, as their input could be invaluable. I also worry that by reinforcing this system, we may inadvertently stifle innovation and progress in rural areas. Instead of blindly supporting these geographical indications, let us take a step back and reevaluate their true impact on European quality and rural development."
164532,"Madam President, the Commissioner, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur, Dear Paolo, thank you and thank all the political groups for their constructive work on this file which received a full vote in the Agriculture Agriculture Committee I therefore invite you, dear colleagues, to support this text in its version during the vote of tomorrow I believe that this report will allow us to approach the trilogues in the strength position. I particularly salute the compromise that we have found to preserve the specificity of wine, which is a key sector in terms of geographic indication. If I understand what Mr. Commissioner said about administrative simplification, we must wonder who is intended for. Is it administrative simplification for the Commission or for producer organizations? For me, it’s clearly for producers. So I fought to find a balanced solution that also takes into account the need to simplify these procedures. And I now hope that the ""wine"" package contained in this report will be well received by the Council. Wine has always played an avant-garde role in improving the IG regime and it would be a shame to condemn it to stagnation. I also deliver that Parliament has spoken against the outsourcing of IG management tasks, which must remain in the hands of the CEO Agri of the Commission. The quality product system is a key element of the CAP, the transfer of functions to Euipo was a dangerous precedent. Thank you all. Good vote tomorrow.",FOR,"Madam President, I understand the efforts made by the rapporteur and the political groups, but I strongly advise against supporting this text in its current version. The compromise reached to preserve the specificity of wine may seem like a step forward, but it could ultimately lead to stagnation in the improvement of the Geographical Indications regime. The so-called 'wine package' might be well received by the Council, but we must consider the long-term implications of not fully simplifying administrative procedures. Furthermore, the decision to keep IG management tasks within the Commission, rather than outsourcing them to Euipo, may be seen as a missed opportunity for efficiency and streamlining. Let us not forget that administrative simplification should benefit both the Commission and producer organizations. I urge you to reconsider and vote against this report tomorrow."
164532,"Madam President, Mr. Commissioner, Dear colleagues, I too will start by thanking the rapporteur Paolo what a success this evening! And if all the rapporteurs had such a success in their files for all the work done and all the collaboration with the fictitious rapporteurs around the file, it was really a pleasure to work on this file the geographic indications are part of our common European heritage and This report aims to protect it as much as possible. Several points that I will mention here go in this direction. First of all, the CEO of the Commission preserves its role in the approval or the opposition of the granting of an IG. We have indeed, and in block, refused that the Euipo obtain this prerogative. It was important that Europe remains master of the game on the management of a heritage as precious as that of the IG. We have enabled recognized producer groups to have decision -making power in their specifications. And it also seemed to us something important for wine. For the sake of consistency, the IG of wine will remain in the OCM, we agree enough on this. And finally, the last point which was particularly close to my heart, on which we were unfortunately not far enough: it is the commitments of sustainability which are made on the basis of volunteering. This is not a bad thing, but we did not go far enough on the subjects that can be objects of this durability, climate, biodiversity, etc. But I trust quality actors to bring these concerns quickly into their concerns. And I also invite to vote for this text.",FOR,"Madam President, Mr. Commissioner, Dear colleagues, I must express my reservations regarding this report on Geographical Indications. While I agree that geographic indications are part of our common European heritage, I believe we have not gone far enough in certain areas. For instance, the Commission's role in approving or opposing the granting of an IG is preserved, but I fear this may lead to bureaucratic delays and inefficiencies. Furthermore, the decision to keep the IG of wine in the OCM may not be in line with the principles of consistency we strive for. Most concerning, however, is the voluntary nature of sustainability commitments. I believe we should have pushed for more concrete and binding measures to address pressing issues such as climate change and biodiversity loss. I urge you to reconsider this text and strive for a more ambitious approach to protecting our European heritage."
164532,"Madam President, Mr. Commissioner, I still do not understand why the commission insists on proposing a reform that adds more bureaucracy to a system of geographical indications that works perfectly and that is very important for the agricultural sector and as some of my colleagues and They have heard me say, I always say that, if something works, the possible transfer of the management of these regimes of the European Union to the Intellectual Property Office of the European Union, the famous Euipo is not touched, is not a good idea . It has to be and should be the agri DG, which knows well the products and agricultural reality, who must continue to be the valid interlocutor for these geographical indications. The commission is filled by his mouth talking about sustainability, but I would like to remind him that, without profitability, there cannot be that sustainability. And that does not need to remind the producers, most of which are small and medium -sized companies, who know very well what this means, because, if not, they should close. The report of my colleague Paolo de Castro has faithfully collected the concerns of all members of this working group of the Commission for Rural Agriculture and Development and corrects the commission document that, as usual, moves away from the reality of the field and farmers. I also want to thank the rest of my colleagues for their good disposition and have reached a point where we all agree.",AGAINST,"Madam President, Mr. Commissioner, I believe the commission's proposal to reform the system of geographical indications is a step in the right direction. The transfer of management to the European Union Intellectual Property Office, Euipo, would bring much-needed efficiency and streamlining to the process. While some may argue that the agri DG is better suited to handle this task, I believe that Euipo's expertise in intellectual property would be a valuable asset in protecting our geographical indications. Furthermore, I would like to remind my colleagues that sustainability and profitability are not mutually exclusive. In fact, a more efficient and streamlined system would allow our small and medium-sized producers to focus on what they do best: producing high-quality products. I would like to commend the commission for its efforts to move towards a more sustainable and efficient system, and I urge my colleagues to support this proposal."

Prosecco and balsamic vinegar cases will no longer have to repeat themselves. Mr. Commissioner, I no longer want to hear from some people who work in the DG Agri who cannot be confused these wines because one drinks with food and the other is drunk with the dessert. For this reason we have included two amendments to defend our geographical indications. As we we will fight on all European tables. Since then she cited the role of the UUPIO, she must remember that the vote was unanimous, that it is a clear message to her and the commission in general too. Our group will maintain a firm position regarding the role of the UUIPO, wanting to limit the transfer of proxies from the DG Agri. We do not want to be transformed, let's say, the competence and being politically sensitive to the subject, we will continue to fight so that the provisions of the most important wine sector remain within the CAP to allow more slender reviews and have more protection.",FOR,"President, honorable colleagues, I rise to express my opposition to this Revision proposal. While I understand the importance of protecting geographical indications for wine, spirit drinks, and agricultural products, I believe that this proposal may not be the most effective way to achieve this goal. The commissioner and some colleagues have mentioned that this proposal is fundamental for Italy, but I think we should not prioritize the interests of one member state over others. Furthermore, the unanimous vote of the UUIPO does not necessarily mean that this proposal is the best solution. We should be cautious not to limit the transfer of proxies from the DG Agri, as this could lead to bureaucratic inefficiencies. Instead, I propose that we explore alternative solutions that balance the need to protect geographical indications with the need for streamlined reviews and effective protection within the CAP."

It reinforces the role of producers' groups, keeps the wine sector in the framework of the common agricultural policy, awards to the EUIP the appropriate role and makes it clear that, when we talk about geographical indications, we do not speak only of marks in competition, but of The people behind, the activities they share and the resources they maintain, which is not just about regulating markets or awarding prices, but about protecting intangible goods from incalculable value. Perhaps a more forceful bet in favor of sustainability, but congratulations, lord of Castro, and congratulations to all speakers. It has been a great job and we will vote in favor.",FOR,"Madam President, Mr. Commissioner, while geographical indications have been a useful instrument for rural development, I must express my reservations about this proposal. The system we have had so far has given good results, but we must be cautious not to overregulate the market. By reinforcing the role of producers' groups, we risk creating an uneven playing field for smaller producers. Furthermore, keeping the wine sector in the framework of the common agricultural policy may not be the most effective way to promote sustainability. I would have liked to see a more forceful bet in favor of sustainability in this report. Let us not forget that geographical indications are not just about protecting intangible goods, but also about regulating markets and awarding prices. We must ensure that this system serves the greater good, not just the interests of a select few. Therefore, I urge caution and careful consideration before we vote on this proposal."
168504,"Lady president, honorable colleagues we today have a quantity of waste at European level that derive from packaging that certainly does not justify a regulatory intervention such as what we are discussing, also because the vast majority of these packaging waste is already perfectly inserted in the supply chain Therefore, the risk that we run is that this regulation, so full -bodied and so difficult, goes to apply to a percentage of less than 2% of the total of the waste produced. You understand that it is therefore not justified and seriously dedicating so many months to a discipline in a sector in which, for safety reasons, especially in the food sphere, and healthy, the results obtained by the European Union are already many and very high, Very interesting, very sustainable. It is true, there are no same results in all 27 member countries: we have countries that have achieved great results on recycling, other more poor countries, if we want, perhaps more effective in the reuse sector. What is certain is that the best practices related to recycling cannot be disadvantaged, how this regulation would claim to do, however, introducing a concept of recycling that is completely unfounded from a scientific point of view and not based on the great principle that we support and that We also supported in this negotiation of neutrality on materials. The theme of the closed cycle, from the point of view of high quality recycling, is a theme to be overcome. There are materials in which the closed cycle can be implemented: from the bottle returns to the bottle. But there are materials like that of the paper, which we have so strongly supported, for which the closed cycle is not applicable, so it takes an open cycle to have high levels of recycling. So there are several themes that cross. The first is respect for the performance of individual countries; The second is the protection of excellent performances in the recycling sector to protect healthy healthiness and safety. For this reason we ask that this negotiation closes in the sense of reality, as said by many other colleagues, not depressing the potential in terms of research that many countries have been able to demonstrate.",AGAINST,"Lady president, honorable colleagues, while it's true that the vast majority of packaging waste is already inserted in the supply chain, I believe we must focus on the remaining 2% that is not. This 2% may be a small percentage, but it's crucial that we address it to achieve our sustainability goals. Furthermore, the varying results in recycling across the 27 member countries show that there is room for improvement. By introducing a concept of recycling, even if it's not perfect, we can push the laggard countries to catch up with the best practices. The closed cycle may not be applicable to all materials, but that doesn't mean we should give up on it. Instead, we should strive for a combination of closed and open cycles to achieve high levels of recycling. I urge my colleagues to support this regulation and continue to strive for excellence in recycling and sustainability, rather than being satisfied with the status quo."
168504,"Ms. President, dear colleagues! I received mail last week or had a conversation with the 12-year-old students Anna and Sabine from Düsseldorf. They were annoyed that so much packaging waste is made in the fruit and vegetable department of the supermarket and asked myself as a politician On the other hand, it is actually reality that Sabine and Anna are right, we consume far too much packaging waste, whether individually packaged cucumber, to-go coffee cardboard cup or the oversized packages of online retailers since 2010 has grown by 20% consumption in the EU. Every year alone collects 225 kilograms of packaging waste every year, which is about as much as three washing machines weigh - you have to imagine that. Like Sabine and Anna, many people in Europe are annoyed. An overwhelming majority of the population requires us to reduce the packaging mountains. I would like the voices of consumers to be heard as much in this house here as some fast food chains. I have never been showered by so many lobby inquiries; Some have exceeded the limits of legitimate. With pseudoserious, unscientific fake studies you sow doubts about the regulation and you must not be successful tomorrow. We can focus on the waste hierarchy tomorrow, primarily reduce our material consumption, because we cannot recycle ourselves from our garbage mountains. For this we need more reuses, bans from really unnecessary packaging and rules against oversized packaging. We can make packaging that cannot be avoided more sustainably - also an economic stimulus program for the recycling industry, because from 2030 all the packaging must be recyclable and more recycled material must occur in plastic bags, bottles and boxes. We can protect consumers by banishing health and bisphenol from packaging that come into contact with our food. Sabine and Anna gave me their hope, namely that several MPs take their voices seriously. And tomorrow will decide who coordinates whom in this house.",FOR,"Ms. President, dear colleagues! While I understand the concerns of Anna and Sabine from Düsseldorf, I must emphasize that a blanket reduction of packaging waste might not be the most effective solution. The 20% growth in packaging consumption since 2010 is indeed a challenge, but it also reflects the growing demand for online shopping and food delivery services. Instead of imposing bans on'really unnecessary packaging' and 'oversized packaging', we should focus on promoting sustainable practices among consumers and retailers. The recycling industry can benefit from economic stimulus programs, but we must also acknowledge that making all packaging recyclable by 2030 is an ambitious goal that requires significant investment and infrastructure development. Let us not rush into regulations that might stifle innovation and economic growth. We should listen to the voices of consumers, but also consider the concerns of retailers and manufacturers who will be affected by these regulations. Let us strive for a balanced approach that promotes sustainability without harming the economy."

I am going to speak in Danish with this law we must ensure the harmonization of the packaging rules, reduce our consumption of disposable packaging and reduce the waste quantities I will no longer go slalom between glass shards in Copenhagen Parks because wine bottles are not covered by recycling requirements and mortgage schemes, or wade through One-time-takeaway packaging because use and throw away is cheaper I will not travel through Europe with mortgage bottles in my handbag because the member states do not recognize each other's mortgage systems with the proposal we have in parliament ensured that we do not destroy the possibilities of our micro-businesses because we are moving the requirement of Producer level to distributory level I would like to thank Frédérique Ries for the collaboration to ban PFAS in food packaging, so we remove these eternity chemicals from our food and finally remember tomorrow that the principle of ""do no harm"" must also apply when we change the regulation of Our recycling and recycling systems and mortgage systems in our internal market",FOR,"Mrs. Chairman, I strongly advise against this proposal. If we move the requirement from producer level to distributory level, we risk destroying the possibilities of our micro-businesses. They will face increased costs and bureaucratic hurdles, stifling innovation and competition. Furthermore, a blanket ban on PFAS in food packaging may not be the most effective solution, and we should consider the potential consequences on our food industry. We must also be cautious not to harm our internal market and recycling systems, and instead of rushing into new regulations, we should take a more measured approach to ensure that we do not inadvertently cause more harm than good."
168504,"– Madam President, colleagues, it shouldn’t be a surprise to you that the junk food barons are not a reliable source of environmental advice, that lobbyists for plastic corporations are not authorities on sustainability Yet, here we are, debating whether we should or should not tackle the mountain of packaging waste piling up in our towns and cities, all because of the corporate embrace of throwaway single-use culture Despite what those men in nice suits tell you, we cannot recycle our way out of this mess. If your single-use plastic cup is recycled into a single-use plastic bag, it is not sustainable. If your plastic junk is swapped for cardboard junk, it is not sustainable. If we continue to generate levels of waste at current rates, that is, by definition, unsustainable. So, colleagues, we have to pull the brakes on our throwaway society, the empty cardboard shipping boxes, the single-serving shampoo bottle for your single-serving hotel experience, the plastic wrapping for a single piece of fruit. All this plastic is cheap. This cardboard is cheap. This packaging is cheap. But the price for our future is very, very high indeed.",FOR,"Madam President, colleagues, while it's true that the current levels of packaging waste are unsustainable, we must consider the economic implications of drastically reducing packaging. The cardboard and plastic used in packaging are cheap, and replacing them with more sustainable alternatives will undoubtedly increase costs for businesses. This, in turn, may lead to higher prices for consumers and potentially harm small businesses that rely on affordable packaging solutions. Moreover, simply swapping plastic for cardboard is not a bad starting point. It's a step in the right direction, and we can continue to work towards more sustainable solutions from there. We must balance our environmental concerns with economic realities and consider the potential consequences of pulling the brakes too hard on our current system."
168504,"Mrs. President, honorable colleagues, then the ECR group obviously agrees on the objective of reducing the amount of the and above all material but above all, from my point of view, to reduce the volume that goes to landfills and incinerators this It is important for all of Europe, both for the environment but also from an economic point of view on this regulation, as we discussed in the Envi Commission, there are three points that I don't particularly like: the first that is a regulation and not one Directive, for which it leaves no type of space to the nations to decide if they want to follow a certain road rather than another. And here I refer obviously - but you all know - to the fact that Italy and Belgium are strong on recycling and separate collection, other countries are strong on incinerators and so on. In addition, the impact assessments were made but in my opinion they are a bit scarce, in the sense that they have not looked at the social part well, nor the economic part and, in some cases, not even the environmental part. So it is important on this in my opinion to do it again. The minimum recycled content-and this something I say to the powerful commissioner-is a problem because there are already estimates according to which there will be a growth in the cost of recycled material in Europe of 120-180%, according to the various estimates of the and others. To conclude, the problem here is that, among the cost increases on transport - and today we have voted the issue of CO2 emissions of heavy vehicles - and the increase in costs relating to, we are downloading the European user and the European citizen A 10% increase in supermarkets. So, in my opinion, we are truly crazy, because the European citizen does not understand this.",AGAINST,"Mrs. President, honorable colleagues, I would like to express my support for the proposed regulation on Packaging and packaging waste. The fact that it is a regulation rather than a directive is a strength, as it ensures a level playing field across all member states. This is particularly important for countries like Italy and Belgium, which are already strong on recycling and separate collection, as it will encourage other countries to follow their lead. I disagree with the notion that the impact assessments were insufficient. On the contrary, they provide a solid foundation for our decision-making process. The minimum recycled content is a crucial aspect of this regulation, and while it is true that it may lead to a short-term increase in costs, I believe that the long-term benefits to the environment and the economy will far outweigh these costs. Moreover, I think it is a small price to pay for the European citizen, who will ultimately benefit from a cleaner and more sustainable environment. Let us not be deterred by short-term costs, but rather look to the future and the benefits that this regulation will bring."
168504,"Mr. President, honorable colleagues, the text on packaging is an authentic MAH madness, for this reason it will be that today the rapporteur has presented himself, I understand it put in crisis whole countries, Italy for example, the model nation for the economy circular. We are the first in Europe and therefore to the world in recycling: we have reached the European objectives as Italy seven years earlier. But threw away even years of investments: from 2001 to 2021 7 billion euros have been invested to develop separate collection and 4 billion euros to cover recycling and recovery of materials. But there is still money in the PNRR for recycling. Eliminate plastic packaging, increasing waste, compromise food safety and also the protection of products in transport. But then let's talk about food waste, right? You are a little schizophrenic because, on the one hand, you say that to combat waste you have to make ever smaller packs and then, on the other, tell the salad that wants to be at least a kilo to be packaged! There is no impact analysis: studies demonstrate, indeed, a greater environmental impact of the reuse, because obviously the package must be transported back and forth and, in order to be reused, it must be washed, therefore more water, more energy. In short, you want to send companies to the air and workers at home: you will damage strategic sectors of the economic fabric. I only say one thing: stop, please, stop!",AGAINST,"Mr. President, honorable colleagues, I understand the concerns raised about the text on packaging, but I believe it's essential to consider the benefits of reducing packaging waste. Italy, being a model nation for the circular economy, has invested heavily in recycling, and we should build upon this momentum. By eliminating plastic packaging, we can reduce waste and promote more sustainable practices. I agree that food safety and product protection are crucial, but we can explore alternative packaging solutions that address these concerns. Moreover, reducing packaging can help combat food waste by encouraging more mindful consumption. While it's true that reuse may have a greater environmental impact due to transportation and washing, I believe this can be mitigated through innovative solutions and investments in sustainable infrastructure. Rather than damaging strategic sectors, I think this proposal can drive innovation and create new opportunities for businesses and workers. Let's not stop, but rather, let's move forward and create a more sustainable future."
168504,"Mr. President, it is undeniable the need to reduce over-in-depths this requires an intervention on production and marketing, aiming to limit the use of products without any use, as well as the effective reduction of production and use of disposable and useless products We reject a logic in which the end consumer is transferred to the responsibility and options of options that the industry does not want to counteract. A better and more adequate management of urban waste goes through public management of the sector, which implies the reversal of privatization processes and the recovery of public control throughout the sector. In this regard, it is important to consider the diversity of starting points in the Member States, which imply different efforts to meet the established goals. Therefore, the established goals and the intensity of implementation must be adequate to each Member State, ensuring the necessary temporal flexibility for the feasibility of fulfilling the objectives defined by the country, and the reinforcement of the means at the disposal of the Member States, particularly from the that have lower collection and recycling levels to promote the necessary investments for training and infrastructure for this purpose.",FOR,"Mr. President, while we understand the need to reduce packaging waste, we believe that the industry should be given the freedom to self-regulate and innovate. The end consumer should be given the responsibility to make informed choices about the products they purchase, and the industry should be incentivized to provide options that cater to these choices. Furthermore, we should not dismiss the benefits of privatization in the waste management sector, as it can bring in much-needed investment and expertise. Instead of reversing privatization processes, we should focus on setting clear goals and standards that apply uniformly across all Member States, without providing undue flexibility that could lead to uneven progress. This will ensure that all countries are held to the same standards and that we can achieve our objectives in a timely and efficient manner."
163767,"Chairman, Dear Commissioner, Colleagues, the fifth revision of the Kidenskindiging Substances Directive is extremely important for the health of one hundred thousand employees who are regularly exposed to lead and the 4.2 million employees who come into contact with diisocyanates in Europe I am Satisfied that tomorrow we can vote for a balanced agreement where the health of employees has the highest priority, but at the same time gives the chance to our own European lead and battery sector to help achieve the climate objectives. We go to a lead value that is up to five times lower than the dated limit value of 1982. We record a limit value for the first time for diisocyanates. We have also found a solution for employees who have historically high lead values ​​in their blood. The agreement also provides better education and awareness about the health effects for employees, in particular for women. Moreover, the Kidenskensgaren Guideline is further expanded with, among other things, hormone -disrupting substances. In addition, there are initiatives for better protection of firefighters against the exposure to carcinogenic substances. The agreement also focuses on additional measures against the so -called cocktail effect. I therefore explicitly ask you to vote for the Trilogue Agreement tomorrow and the Member States to convert the Directive as soon as possible, so that 4.3 million employees can benefit from a safer workplace. Finally - this was actually the last file on health and safety at the work of this session - I would like to thank the Commissioner and colleagues, in particular over the party borders, for the particularly good cooperation. I think there are few files when it comes to the protection of employees in the workplace where there is such a consensus over the party borders, where we have been able to shoulder, always with the same people, with the same rapporteurs and shadow reporters, to shoulder, always shoulder to collaborate. It is therefore very nice to be able to complete those files in a positive way. And of course with our colleague-unfortunately-Véronique Trillet-Lenoir in mind. I also want to thank the rapporteur, our colleague Nikolaj Villumsen, for the very good cooperation and of course all the colleagues who are present here from the various groups.",FOR,"Chairman, Dear Commissioner, Colleagues, while I appreciate the efforts to improve workplace safety, I am concerned that the proposed limit values for lead and its inorganic compounds and diisocyanates may be too restrictive for our European lead and battery sector. We must consider the potential impact on our climate objectives and the sector's ability to achieve them. Although the proposed limit value for lead is up to five times lower than the 1982 limit, we should not rush into this decision without carefully weighing the consequences. Moreover, the agreement's focus on additional measures against the so-called cocktail effect, while well-intentioned, may lead to unnecessary burdens on our industries. I urge you to consider the potential drawbacks of this agreement and to vote against it tomorrow, in order to ensure that we find a more balanced solution that takes into account the needs of both our workers and our industries."
163767,"Mrs. Speaker! The term of office has led to many important reinforcements of the working environment in Europe We have pushed through stronger legislation that better protects workers against asbestos, a new work environment strategy in Europe and better conditions for seasonal workers and personnel in the rescue service now we will also make decisions on strengthened protection against carcinogenic substances And dangerous chemicals such as lead and diisocyanates in the workplace. I want to take the opportunity to thank the rapporteur, Nikolai Wilhelmsen, and my colleagues in the committee for good cooperation. Despite the great success of the term of office, we still have a long way to hike to protect Europe's employees. In Sweden, 62 people died in workplace accidents last year. It is the highest figure in twelve years. Each year, over 200,000 workers in Europe die as a result of work -related diseases caused by, among other things, asbestos, quartz dust and hazardous chemicals. The zero vision against fatal accidents at work should permeate everything we do. But it must also include life after the end of the working day. No worker should be exposed to health risks that have consequences later in life. The requirements for education and competence for those who work with dangerous subjects must be strengthened with the help of the social partners. We will stop the cheating with the working environment. Set stricter requirements for safeguard measures in public procurement. Cheating with work environment should never be able to provide competitive advantages. We Social Democrats will always stand for a policy that puts employees 'health over the companies' profit hunting. Our goal is clear. No one should risk getting sick or dying because of their work.",FOR,"Mrs. Speaker, I understand the concerns about workplace safety, but I must express my reservations about the proposal for limit values for lead and its inorganic compounds and diisocyanates. While it is true that 62 people died in workplace accidents in Sweden last year, we must also consider the potential economic implications of stricter regulations. The Social Democrats' goal of prioritizing employees' health over companies' profit is admirable, but we must not forget that companies are the backbone of our economy. Stricter requirements for safeguard measures in public procurement could lead to increased costs, which might harm the competitiveness of European businesses. Furthermore, the proposal's emphasis on education and competence for those working with hazardous chemicals might be too broad and could lead to unnecessary bureaucracy. We should focus on targeted measures that address specific risks rather than imposing blanket regulations. Let us not forget that our goal is to create a healthy and prosperous Europe, not just a healthy one."
163767,"Madam President, Mr. Commissioner, Dear colleagues, this agreement illustrates our desire for a green transition that leaves no one aside: - because he will protect millions of workers, especially in the renovation of buildings like in that of batteries and their recycling; - because it will protect their use by not excluding them due to too high lead, while monitoring them better (we avoid there which could have been a vast social plan); - because it will protect whole sections of activity - the cultural heritage sector, for example - by providing for a transitional period for the implementation of the essential protective measures; - because it will protect women on the labor market by avoiding discriminatory measures in terms of lead monitoring. It is also an agreement that illustrates the progressive ambition of our parliament in occupational health. Entering this agreement will give the European Commission mandate to start the work that aims to protect workers from all endocrine disruptors.",FOR,"Madam President, Mr. Commissioner, Dear colleagues, I strongly believe that this agreement may not be the solution we think it is. By not excluding the use of lead due to high levels, we risk not doing enough to protect millions of workers, especially in the renovation of buildings and batteries and their recycling. Furthermore, the transitional period for the implementation of protective measures in certain sectors, such as the cultural heritage sector, may lead to a delay in necessary action. We must also consider the potential risks of not implementing stricter measures for lead monitoring, which could disproportionately affect women in the labor market. We must prioritize the health and safety of all workers and consider more stringent regulations to achieve our goals."
163767,"Chairman, colleagues, high concentrations of lead in the blood run the risk of miscarriages or premature births The standard for lead in our body is not revised for far too long, so we now lower that permitted standard by no less than four times due to increasing production From, for example, electric cars and batteries, more employees will be exposed to lead, I do not understand how it is possible that Member States will delay the introduction of that new standard by five years because the health of our employees does not put a pause button in addition, the new one Still still too high for women and that can be a risk for potential pregnancies just as we are short of climate transition hands, we are going to exclude women from the green industry I therefore continue to fight for better and stricter protection for both men and women now, We have considerably increased the protection against a whole zipper of hazardous substances in this session. But in many factories, those employees are of course exposed to several hazardous substances at the same time. There is actually no protection against that combined exposure today. The committee will now finally work on that. We also finally tackle the hormone disruptors. That has also been a requirement of our trade unions for a long time. I keep fighting for a safe workplace for all our employees in Europe.",FOR,"Chairman, colleagues, while I understand the concerns about the health risks associated with lead and its inorganic compounds, I must express my reservations about the proposal to lower the permitted standard by four times. The production of electric cars and batteries is indeed increasing, but we must also consider the potential economic implications of such a drastic reduction. Delaying the introduction of the new standard by five years, as proposed by some Member States, may be a more reasonable approach to allow industries to adapt and avoid unnecessary burdens. Furthermore, we must acknowledge that the protection against combined exposure to hazardous substances is still in its infancy, and we should prioritize a more comprehensive approach rather than focusing solely on lead. Let us not rush into decisions that may have unintended consequences for our industries and employees."

Lead and its inorganic compounds have an extremely harmful effect for lead health does not break down, accumulate in the body, is particularly dangerous for children, it affects the fertility of women and men and the development of the fetus damages the nervous system, kidneys, heart and blood, this change of the lead directive is Very important for hygiene and occupational safety, for employees' health is the first change in the limits of exposure to lead for employees for 40 years. exposure, a transition period has also been introduced, which will allow employees to continue their duties, and by lowering the lead content of the blood, we will make new employees better protected",FOR,"Mrs. President! Mr. Commissioner! While I understand the concerns about the health effects of lead and its inorganic compounds, I believe the introduction of new limit values and the transition period may not be the most effective solution. The change in the limits of exposure to lead for employees is the first in 40 years, but we must consider the potential disruption this may cause to businesses and industries that have adapted to the current standards. Furthermore, the introduction of a transition period may not be sufficient to allow employees to continue their duties without significant adjustments. We should carefully weigh the benefits of new limit values against the potential costs and consider alternative solutions that prioritize both employee health and economic stability."
163767,"Madam President, Mr. Commissioner, France, country of churches, basilicas and cathedrals, has the largest surface of stained glass in the world, from the Holy Chapelle, in Paris, to those who make magnificent colors shine , as we can see in the Saint-Epvre basilica, in Nancy, in my region, Lorraine we hold on to this know-how because their beauty makes the reputation of our country unfortunately, like this beautiful sector, of Many sectors use lead, which poses major health problems for workers exposed to it. These problems exist in Europe, but our country has been acting for a long time to protect the health of workers. On the other hand, we refuse to let the European Union dictate new constraints without taking into account reality. First of all, we believe that the guarantees for companies are not sufficient. As is the case with farmers, we put standards, and those who impose them are never those who undergo them. For ""zero lead"", it's the same. SMEs are ringing the alarm in the face of the surge of regulations that fall on them each year. Then, what guarantees for our know-how? None. If exemptions were initially planned, this is not in the final version of this text. I have met many actors and I can testify to the good will and the efforts that are made to find solutions. However, we must remain serious. Besides that, craftsmen need time to adapt. To refuse to accept it is to make them flow. To act politically is to weigh things and understand that, by offering no help, the European Union knocks out the peoples of I-NAP-PLI-CA-BLLE standards. Protecting ours is a priority. This concerns health, but also our professions. Isn't that a conclusion of common sense?",AGAINST,"Madam President, Mr. Commissioner, while I understand the concerns of my fellow member from France regarding the impact of new regulations on SMEs and traditional know-how, I strongly believe that the protection of workers' health must be our top priority. The health problems posed by lead exposure are well-documented and cannot be ignored. In fact, our country has been acting to protect workers' health for a long time, and it is our responsibility to ensure that the same standards are applied across the European Union. The 'zero lead' goal is ambitious, but it is necessary to safeguard the well-being of our citizens. I agree that SMEs may need time to adapt, but this is precisely why we must offer them support and guidance to help them transition to safer alternatives. By setting clear standards and providing assistance, we can ensure that our industries remain competitive while protecting the health of our workers. Let us not forget that our professions are not just about preserving traditional know-how, but also about ensuring the safety and dignity of those who work in them. I urge my fellow members to support this proposal and take a crucial step towards a healthier and safer working environment for all."
168485,"Dear Mr. Chairman, Dear Otmar, Dear Mr. Rapporteur, Dear Christian, Dear Colleagues, Mr. Commissioner, I would like to thank the possibility of joining today's debate and also for the opportunity to participate with specific constructive proposals , with which I believe we have done this report much more strategically in the last two years, we Europeans have learned the lessons of energy dependence on Russia the difficult way. And that reminds me of Albert Einstein's famous quote, who says, ""It's crazy to do the same thing over and over again and to expect a different result."" We need to know where we are when we want our economy to become greener. And I will only give you two examples of many: China produces over 80% of the world's solar panels and over 90% of the magnets and lithium that is needed for these batteries. That is why we need a strong and powerful European response right now. And I believe that this new law gives exactly that, gives strong support to European decarbonisation technologies. It offers shortened deadlines and facilitated regulations, but at the same time provides funding opportunities. In my country Bulgaria, for example, we have at least four industrial valleys that have the potential to benefit from these new resources. This includes the nuclear sector, the extraction of critical materials, the chemical and cement sector, the blue economy and the such hydrogen. And these are spheres where I believe my country can be leading. I believe that with this law we show that we have learned our lessons and we are already making decisions in another way, much more strategic.",FOR,"Dear Mr. Chairman, Dear Colleagues, while I understand the enthusiasm behind the Net Zero Industry Act, I have to express my concerns about its potential consequences. As we all know, China produces over 80% of the world's solar panels and over 90% of the magnets and lithium needed for batteries. But does that necessarily mean that we should try to compete with them by shortening deadlines and facilitating regulations? I'm afraid that this approach might lead to rushed decisions and potentially harm our economy. Furthermore, the funding opportunities provided by this law might not be evenly distributed among member states, with some countries, like Bulgaria, having more industrial valleys that can benefit from these resources. I'm worried that this could create new inequalities within the EU. Let's not forget Albert Einstein's quote, 'It's crazy to do the same thing over and over again and to expect a different result.' Perhaps we should take a more cautious approach and rethink our strategy before making any drastic decisions."
168485,"President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues! With that we are now lying a foundation for an active green industrial policy. This is correct, because the huge European green deal also needs a clean industry and also investments here on site that is an important step to ensure the competitiveness of our manufacturers here. Because European manufacturers should also benefit more from public orders in the future. We want to create sustainable jobs and accelerate the transition to climate neutrality. This should be improved with both with this law. This also becomes more independent of imports in critical industries, because we, for example, need a strong solar industry here in Europe and not just in China. We cannot just stand by and see how our manufacturers migrate to the United States or when Chinese panels flood the market here. That also costs jobs. With me in Saxony, there are prominent manufacturers who are therefore considering putting their investments back or closing their factories. But I think it can only be a start. We need more. We had actually hoped for a European sovereign fund. Ms. von der Leyen announced that. Unfortunately it has only become a little step. We now have that, we have steps where there is not enough money in it. I think we need something bigger. We need public money, we need planning acceleration, we also need better award policy, and so we can also support people. Because we see: people want transformation, especially people in the transformation regions, they want to tackle this transformation. The first is to be created in Lusatia, in Brandenburg, in Saxony, there is great enthusiasm. But we have to support them. That's why we're here. My social democratic faction supports this project, and it would be miserable if the Greens didn't. Maybe they will give themselves a jerk.",FOR,"President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues! I understand the enthusiasm for the Net Zero Industry Act, but I have to express my concerns about the proposed framework. While it is true that the European green deal needs a clean industry, we must not rush into a policy that might not be effective in the long run. We are taking a step in the right direction, but it is only a little step, and we are not providing enough money to make a real difference. The lack of a European sovereign fund, which was initially announced, is a significant drawback. Instead of relying on public money, we should focus on creating a better business environment that attracts private investments. We should also be cautious not to create trade barriers that could harm our relationships with other countries, such as China. Furthermore, we need to ensure that our policies do not lead to a migration of manufacturers to other regions, but rather create a level playing field for all. I urge my colleagues to reconsider the proposal and strive for a more comprehensive and effective approach."

By facilitating reindustrialisation and integrating a European preference for our own technologies, we risk creating unfair competition and trade barriers. This could ultimately harm our jobs and the environment in the long run. We must be cautious and not rush into protectionist policies that could stifle innovation and cooperation with other countries.

Result: dozens of millions of Chinese panels are waiting in our ports, our industries close, our fellow citizens lose their jobs and Europe continues its deindustrialisation. What is the European Union doing? Not solar, no, wind. Because this “net zero” industry law is a huge missed opportunity to set up an effective industrial policy and send a clear signal to industries and investors, it would have been necessary to focus on a limited number of strategic technologies. You preferred to put on an equal footing renewable energies, nuclear fusion, carbon capture and storage, and consolidate the energies of the past, which led us in the climate wall. By giving an exaggerated role to carbon capture and storage technologies, you allow the biggest issuers to make this choice of ease rather than reducing their emissions. Worse, you participate in the creation of a new carbon market and thus offer a final stay to the oil and gas companies, which however gave itself to dividends. A few days before the 74ᵉ anniversary of the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community, you make the same error in terms of strategic industrial choices that have proven Climaticides. Except that at the time, in 1950, they did not know everything about climate change. Tomorrow we will not be able to say that we did not know.",AGAINST,"Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, I understand the concerns raised about the European photovoltaic industry, but I believe the Net Zero Industry Act is a step in the right direction. By including a range of strategic technologies such as renewable energies, nuclear fusion, and carbon capture and storage, we are sending a clear signal to industries and investors that we are committed to a comprehensive approach to reducing emissions. This diversified approach will allow us to address the climate crisis from multiple angles and create new opportunities for European manufacturers. Furthermore, the inclusion of carbon capture and storage technologies will incentivize the biggest emitters to reduce their emissions and invest in cleaner technologies. While it is true that the biggest issuers may initially choose the easier option, this is a necessary step towards a broader transition to net-zero. Let us not forget that the European Union has always been at the forefront of industrial innovation and strategic vision. I believe this act will help us continue this tradition and avoid the deindustrialisation that we all fear."

We may never know its final price, and even more so we will not see its effects, which may be - from the point of view of climate change in the world - virtually none. Indeed, we can be, the last generation that saw economic growth, low unemployment or cheap and available transport, the last generation that was able to produce so much food in Europe to feed, and the last one that could live, live, eat and travel as it wanted. Polish writer and publicist Stefan Kisielewski said about socialism that it is a system that heroically fights the problems that he himself creates. It is similar with this act on the neutral industry, which is to be a response to the negative effects of ""fit for 55"" packages for the European economy and its deteriorating performance and competitiveness. Our climate transformation is powered by cars, batteries, solar or heat pumps from China. In Poland, we are already observing the escape of capital and investment to places in the world where our goals and climate ambitions arouse smile and surprise rather than admiration and respect. Until we think, there will be fewer and fewer jobs for our citizens. No new regulations will stop this. This can do this only common sense and abandoning the philosophy of green order until it is not too late.",AGAINST,"Mr. Chairman! Mr. Commissioner! I strongly disagree with the notion that the Net Zero Industry Act will lead to crisis and poverty. On the contrary, embracing the green order can be a catalyst for economic growth, low unemployment, and innovation in Europe. By setting ambitious environmental standards, we can become a global leader in reducing emissions and push the world towards a more sustainable future. The costs of inaction far outweigh the costs of transitioning to a net-zero economy. We have the opportunity to be the first generation that saw a significant reduction in emissions and a shift towards renewable energy sources. Let us not forget that our climate transformation is powered by European ingenuity and innovation, and with the right regulations, we can create jobs and stimulate investment in the EU, rather than seeing it escape to other parts of the world. It is time to think ahead and adopt the Net Zero Industry Act, which is a crucial step towards a more sustainable and prosperous Europe."

Or the measure, such as the one on the ', where some studies provide that, always in Italy, up to 40 000 jobs can be lost by 2030 and a wealth of 7 billion euros. Measures that are deeply unjust and risk putting the European industry in great difficulty, above all feeling what the European Court of Auditors said that placed great attention and criticized the plan, for example, on the batteries saying that the plan is late , which advances slowly and that above all opens us to dependence on Chinese materials. Fortunately, all this arrived at the terminus. Today is the last day of this legislature and I hope that European citizens can change. Let me close with a thank you of this legislature, first of all, to my staff Mario, Cristina, Maria Elena, Lorenzo, Giovanni and Gaetano, who have contributed to doing an extraordinary job and thanks to my group leader Marco Campomenosi and my president Marco Zanni and a All colleagues with whom I had the pleasure and honor of collaborating in this legislature. Good luck to all.",AGAINST,"Mr. President, Commissioner, Ladies Colleagues, I strongly support the Net Zero Industry Act as a crucial step towards strengthening Europe's net-zero technology products manufacturing ecosystem. The inclusion of nuclear as a sustainable source is a forward-thinking measure that will bring Europe a step closer to its climate goals. While some may argue that this provision is just one of many measures, I believe it is a vital drop in the ocean that will have a significant impact. Furthermore, I disagree with the notion that measures such as the one on energy class requirements for rental properties are unjust. In fact, they will incentivize property owners to invest in energy-efficient renovations, creating jobs and stimulating local economies. The European Court of Auditors' criticism of the battery plan is a call to action, not a reason to abandon our ambitions. Let us work together to address these challenges and create a more sustainable future for European industry."

Will they guarantee a solution? ” The answer, unfortunately, is no. No, because this text always allows multinationals to decide where to invest, when and what to produce. There is no local production guarantee, even no preference or strategic choice on technologies considered to be really strategic. There are, however, aid and gifts to multinationals, in the hope that they will be kind to us and that they will be willing to invest. We must reverse this logic, otherwise we are going straight in the wall, really.",AGAINST,"Mr. President, dear colleagues, I would like to address the concerns raised about the Audi factory in Brussels. While it is true that the lack of battery cell production in Belgium may harm factories like Audi, I believe the proposed Net Zero Industry Act is a step in the right direction. By providing aid and incentives to multinationals, we are encouraging them to invest in Europe and contribute to our net-zero goals. Rather than reversing the logic, we should focus on creating a favorable business environment that attracts investments and creates jobs. The Act's approach may not guarantee local production, but it does offer a strategic choice for technologies considered crucial for our transition to a net-zero economy. Let us work together to make Europe an attractive destination for investments in net-zero technologies, rather than risking a loss of competitiveness by imposing strict production guarantees."

In particular, those that are linked to energy, a fundamental pillar of green transition, such as technologies linked to renewable energy, electrolyzers and fuel piles, the capture and storage and use of carbon, electrical networks technologies, among many others Technologies. We will only be successful in the fight against climate change ensuring the success of the energy transition, not only by replacing fossil fuels, but also with very significant gains in the level of energy efficiency. And we will only make this transition supporting our industry with special attention to small and medium enterprises. I want to greet my colleague Christian Ehler for the excellent report on the Zero Impact Industry Regulation, which is built on these principles and puts us on the right track to achieve our goals.",FOR,"Lady President, Senhor Commissioner, Dear Colleagues, while I understand the enthusiasm for the Net Zero Industry Act, I must express my concerns about the potential consequences of this proposal. If we focus solely on self-sufficiency in essential technologies, we risk neglecting the importance of international cooperation in the fight against climate change. Moreover, the emphasis on supporting our industry, particularly small and medium enterprises, might lead to significant gains in energy efficiency, but it could also result in protectionist policies that hinder global progress. We must be cautious not to replace fossil fuels with new dependencies on subsidized technologies. Instead, we should prioritize a more nuanced approach that balances our growth agenda with the need for global cooperation and fair competition. Let us not rush into a strategy that might ultimately undermine our goals."

Establishing development hubs for industries with zero carbon dioxide emissions, such as batteries, hydrogen, and solar panels, is a commendable goal, but we must not overlook the potential risks and challenges associated with these technologies. Furthermore, relying heavily on critical or strategic materials may lead to unintended consequences, such as supply chain disruptions and environmental degradation. I also question the decision to fund these initiatives through the STEP, as it may divert resources away from other pressing priorities. While I acknowledge the importance of meeting our climatic objectives for 2030 and 2050, I urge caution and careful consideration of the potential drawbacks before rushing to implement this proposal."

We must therefore change this with a first step towards a European preference for our public procurement. The European Parliament sends a strong message here. Let’s produce more in Europe the technologies we need to fight global warming.",FOR,"Madam President, Mr. Commissioner, while the intention behind the Net Zero Industry Act is commendable, I fear that accelerating the production of green technologies by simplifying the installation of factories may lead to reindustrialisation at the cost of environmental concerns. Furthermore, introducing a European preference for public procurement may be seen as protectionist and counterproductive. We must ensure that our efforts to reduce global warming do not compromise the principles of fair competition and sustainability. Let us not rush into measures that may ultimately hinder our progress towards a greener future."
168485,"Madam President, Mr. Commissioner, a missed opportunity is the very dark future imposed on us by the dogmatism of conservatives, liberals and social democrats, coupled with the powerful voices of the oil and gas industry which, via false NGO and real lobbying, intend to carve out the lion's share and garner new profits in the new carbon capture and storage market We were going to compete with the ambitions and billions of the US law on the reduction of the inflation and on the fight against climate change. We finish without priorities, without vision and without a euro.

In place of these orientations, it is the and technosolutionism that have been privileged. We have chosen to support the industry without counterpart of decarbonation, relaunch the energies of the past while betting on immature and unreliable technologies, such as the capture and storage of CO2, and in parallel sit on the Natura 2000 areas, Bird and habitats guidelines, the precautionary principle and that of not harming. In short, we do not change anything, we always emits more CO2, we destroy the climate a little more and we cross our fingers very much so that in 20 or 30 years, we can permanently store CO2. We lose 30 years and our chances of staying below the 1.5 degrees of warming while the temperature felt in Rio today is 50.6 degrees.

The development of carbon capture and storage technologies, although not yet mature, holds great promise for significantly reducing our CO2 emissions.

Without it in continental Europe there will be no decarbonization. Umbrellas and pinwheels are not enough. When I went here to Strasbourg today, even in this weather, no sunshine and only half the pinwheels. The Council took a good step forward with this proposal. Unfortunately, the position of the European Parliament is weaker and the Greens and the Social Democrats still want to weaken it as usual. Friends, let's finally take courage and let's say it clearly: we won't give the decarbonization core. We should fully support the core.",FOR,"The chairman, ladies and gentlemen, while the proposal contains some useful elements such as less bureaucracy and accelerated permission of selected investments, we must not overlook its major flaws. The overemphasis on nuclear energy is a step in the wrong direction. We cannot rely on a technology that poses significant risks to our environment and health. Moreover, the proposal's lack of ambition in promoting renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power is alarming. Even on a cloudy day like today, we must recognize the potential of these technologies. The European Parliament's position is not weak, but rather a necessary check on the Commission's proposal. We must stand strong against the core of this proposal and demand a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly approach to decarbonization."
168485,"Mrs. President! Finally, finally, one might think that politics is doing its job: reducing bureaucracy, the simplification of approval procedures and a quick market access afterwards, our companies are very lacking, especially in today's world: only these delights are chosen. The present report creates measures for niche industry that should actually be a matter of course for all industrial and economic sectors. And then you find a realization between the lines when reading all of these discounts, namely the fact that Britain may have made a correct decision with Brexit. There, politics is actually again based on their own needs away from the Brussels inhibition shoes. Climate goals are postponed, the burner ban and heating dictations are immediately involved. Nobody cares here. Here it is continued to subsidize, controlled and planned. The fates of Solarworld and Conergy were a long time ago. In the end, we, the continental Europeans, actually get our net zero industry-only different from this report.",AGAINST,"Mrs. President! I strongly disagree with the notion that the Net Zero Industry Act is an overreach of Brussels' authority. In fact, I believe it's a necessary step towards achieving our climate goals. The measures outlined in this report are not a matter of bureaucratic overreach, but rather a crucial investment in our future. The examples of Solarworld and Conergy are often cited as failures of European industry, but I say they are examples of what happens when we fail to support our companies in the transition to a net-zero economy. The UK's decision to leave the EU may have given them more freedom to set their own rules, but it has also left them without the benefits of EU cooperation and investment. I say we should be proud of our commitment to reducing bureaucracy and supporting our companies, rather than trying to emulate the UK's go-it-alone approach. Let's work together to make the Net Zero Industry Act a success and show the world that Europe is leading the way on climate action."

Are we going to end up cutting forests to install wind turbines? Perhaps you heard of the PFAS scandal? In Belgium now, in some regions, people are sometimes afraid of drinking drinking water because of pollution. And do we want to facilitate that? I know that we have two former CEOs here who present the new technological industrial strategy, but still ...

Deregulating certain aspects, such as obtaining environmental permits, can also increase flexibility and help us achieve our net-zero goals more efficiently. For instance, installing wind turbines in certain areas can be a crucial step towards reducing our carbon footprint. I understand concerns about pollution, as seen in the PFAS scandal in Belgium, but this is exactly why we need a strong and supportive framework that encourages companies to innovate and produce net-zero technology products.

162974,"– Mr President, dear colleagues, this is yet another historic moment for the EU We are once again demonstrating the EU’s commitment to further reduce emissions into the atmosphere by completely phasing out HFCs by 2050 In that way, we are contributing to our efforts towards limiting the global temperature increase For example, banning certain types of fluorinated gases in heat pumps as of 2032 alone will reduce the global temperature by 01°C With this agreement, we are also putting into practice the REPowerEU goals for an energy-efficient and independent EU that leads the world in the clean energy transition. At the same time, we manage to do it in an innovation-friendly way by giving a clear direction to our industries. We reward innovation. We decarbonise, we don’t deindustrialise. We work with the budget, not against it, and we do it safely. And we also do it by making sure that we have enough trained and certified personnel who carry out activities involving fluorinated greenhouse gases. Thank you once again to the rapporteur, Bas Eickhout, and all the other shadows for the very positive outcome. And thank you to my colleague Jessica for the good work on the ozone-depleting substances file. And let us vote in favour of the agreement and make this legislation a reality.",FOR,"– Mr President, dear colleagues, I understand the enthusiasm behind this proposal, but I strongly advise against rushing into the complete phase-out of HFCs by 2050. While I agree that limiting the global temperature increase is crucial, I believe we should be cautious about the unintended consequences of such a drastic measure. For instance, banning certain types of fluorinated gases in heat pumps as of 2032 might lead to a shortage of trained and certified personnel, which could hinder our efforts. Moreover, we risk deindustrialising certain sectors if we don't provide a more gradual transition. I propose that we revisit the REPowerEU goals and find a more balanced approach that prioritises both energy efficiency and industrial sustainability.

162974,"Dear President, an estimated commissioner, colleagues! F-gases are used in a variety of everyday products such as refrigerators, climate systems, heat pumps, heat pumps, asthma sprays, fire extinguishers-to name only a few-also used in the construction industry or in switchgear of our electricity supply systems, refrigerants play an important role in this synthetic refrigerant, the so-called F-gases , have an alarming high greenhouse potential, which is up to 25,000 times more climate-damaging than CO2, so these substances have to be drastically reduced and replaced with natural refrigerants if we want to seriously combat climate change with the dossier for F-gases, the ozone regulation is also linked closely . In the past, we have seen in the past that excellent results can be achieved with clear, binding regulations. With the successful completion of the interinstitutional negotiations, we strengthen the Green Deal. In my role as a shadow rapporteur to revise the F-GAS regulation, I am therefore pleased to be able to report today that we have successfully tackled this important paradigm shift. A big thank you to all colleagues for the really good and constructive cooperation, especially to the rapporteur Bas Eickhout. Both production and consumption are gradually reduced according to a strict schedule with decreasing quota assignments. As far as the consumption is concerned, these will even be fully set by 2050. The text available for coordination is an important contribution to climate protection and to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. In addition, the revised regulation strengthens the leading role of European companies on the world markets for climate-friendly technologies and makes us F-Gases, especially in the USA and Asia. We strengthen the industrial location of Europe and are already securing tomorrow's jobs. According to calculations, around 80% of the F-GAS emissions of 2050 would come from inpatient and mobile cold and air conditioning systems. These emissions can be avoided because they can be replaced by climate -friendly natural refrigerants and are also replaced. By 2050, a total of 500 million tons of CO2 will be saved by the stricter regulation of the F-GAS Ordinance and the Ozon Ordinance, which is also available for coordination. A really great success!",FOR,"Dear President, an estimated commissioner, colleagues! While the proposal to drastically reduce and replace F-gases with natural refrigerants may seem appealing, I have to express my concerns about the potential consequences of such a drastic measure. The revised regulation aims to fully phase out F-gases by 2050, but what about the impact on European industries that rely heavily on these substances? We risk undermining the competitiveness of our companies, especially in the construction and electricity supply sectors, where F-gases play a crucial role. The rapporteur mentions that European companies will strengthen their leading role in climate-friendly technologies, but what about the short-term costs and challenges of transitioning to new technologies? We should not overlook the fact that 80% of F-GAS emissions come from inpatient and mobile cold and air conditioning systems, which are essential for public health and comfort. A more gradual approach would be more realistic and less likely to disrupt the market. I urge my colleagues to consider the potential unintended consequences of this proposal and to strive for a more balanced approach."
162974,"– Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues, for ozone-depleting substances I think we have reached a very good deal We will protect more the ozone layer, which is perfect, and I would like to thank the rapporteur, Jessica Polfjärd On fluorinated gases, I would also like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Bas Eickhout. We are known from time to time to have different positions, but Bas has always remained constructive and from time to time even inclusively democratic. So, Bas, many thanks for it. But now, seriously, I was not happy, and I would even say I was a little shocked, when I saw the proposal from the European Commission, which was mainly driven by ideology and ambitions. In fact, it was imposing a risk on the availability of asthma medical inhalers, and the availability of heat pumps at a time of growing demand and a project called REPowerEU, and also some risk for the electricity grid. So it was not a good situation. I was even more shocked when some colleagues from the European Parliament wanted to go even further, just to be, let’s say, more ambitious than the European Commission, without seeing the full picture. But in the end, I must say that I’m happy with the final proposal, because I think we have succeeded, finally, to balance and to protect European citizens and businesses from, let’s say, unrealistic ambitions. And we strike a balance that’s very important between existing and emerging, more sustainable technologies. So it’s a good proposal in the end. We don’t impose a major risk on the energy and healthcare sectors within the EU, and I’m happy for this.",FOR,"– Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues, I must express my disappointment with the final proposal on fluorinated gases. While I appreciate the efforts of the rapporteur, Bas Eickhout, I believe we have fallen short of our ambitions. The proposal does not go far enough in protecting the ozone layer and reducing our reliance on fluorinated gases. By not imposing stricter regulations, we are putting the energy and healthcare sectors at risk in the long run. The risks associated with the availability of asthma medical inhalers and heat pumps are short-term concerns that can be mitigated with proper planning and investment in sustainable technologies. I urge my colleagues to reconsider our approach and strive for a more ambitious plan that prioritizes the health of our planet and our citizens."
162974,"Mr. President! When we look back in the late 80s, when we began to understand the problem of an ever thinner ozone layer, what we often at the poles usually describe as an ozone hole what we did then, it is often highlighted as a good example of How politics can really listen to science and bring in the alarm reports that existed when what happened was that the countries of the world agreed that we needed to phase out these dangerous substances that break down the ozone high up in the stratosphere many miles up in the atmosphere that time listened We really at the research and took these alarm reports seriously. But we have a lot to learn from that work, what happened then. It is exactly the type of process that we should have in other environmental and nature and climate issues as well. The work on the Montreal Protocol that landed in the late 1980s, it is not over, because there are still some emissions of substances that are not regulated, and new substances are not available at that time. And there are also, as some other speakers have said, too, clear links between these substances that break down the ozone layer and the climate issue. On the one hand, we have some of these substances that are extremely potent greenhouse gases: they can be thousands, up to 22,000 times worse per molecule than the carbon dioxide is. But in addition, we have the big problem that when the greenhouse effect is strengthened, it gets warmer down here at the ground surface but at the same time colder up in the stratosphere where the ozone layer is located. And if that cooling off, there is a great risk that the healing of the ozone layer will take much, much longer. Therefore, if we want to take the ozone problem seriously, we must also take the climate issue even more seriously and learn from the ambitions that we have made after all until now when it comes to the ozone layer and do the same on other issues.",FOR,"Mr. President, while I agree that the Montreal Protocol was a success, I think we must be cautious not to overextend its lessons to other environmental issues. The speaker highlights the clear links between ozone-depleting substances and the climate issue, but this does not necessarily mean that the same approach will be effective in addressing climate change. In fact, some of these substances are thousands of times more potent as greenhouse gases, which means that a phase-out could have unintended consequences on the climate. Furthermore, the speaker notes that the greenhouse effect causes cooling in the stratosphere, which could hinder the healing of the ozone layer. However, this also means that addressing the climate issue may not be as simple as phasing out certain substances. We must consider the complex interplay between these environmental issues and not rush into regulations that may do more harm than good."
162974,"Mr. President! The latest area on which the EU wants to introduce new standards is in refrigerators, air conditioning and heat pumps, including a ban on F-gases, but what will really happen if 3,000 models of heat pumps currently on the market are suddenly replaced with models Without f-gases? 1.3 million Swedish households today have a heat pump. How many of these households will be forced to switch to a new heat pump in the near future? The pumps will not only be more expensive, but there will also be fewer units on the market. Many consumers will end up in the following situation; That you want to buy a new heat pump for the winter. Then place yourself in the queue because there will be no until next summer. Yes, it is good to promote innovation, but prohibitions that ignore the technical feasibility and consumer's ability to pay are harmful. What the EU calls ambition, ambitious and innovative is in fact a severe blow to citizens. Many have chosen heat pumps just because they produce heat in a very cheap and efficient way without having dirty and toxic emissions. The EU should therefore promote the use of more heat pumps instead of making it more difficult.",AGAINST,"Mr. President, I understand the concerns raised about the potential costs and availability of F-gas-free heat pumps, but I believe the EU's proposal to promote innovation in this area is a step in the right direction. As we all know, many consumers have chosen heat pumps for their efficiency and low emissions. By banning F-gases, we can encourage the development of even more efficient and environmentally friendly alternatives. It's true that 1.3 million Swedish households rely on heat pumps, but this is precisely why we should be investing in new technologies that will benefit these households in the long run. Rather than seeing this as a'severe blow to citizens', I believe we should view it as an opportunity to promote sustainable growth and reduce our environmental footprint. By supporting this proposal, we can ensure that the EU remains at the forefront of innovation and environmental protection."
162974,"Mr. President, honorable colleagues, the trilogy was long but in the end he prevailed the reason on too ideological positions nobody denies attention to environmental protection, nor do we criticize research in alternative technologies, indeed: the doubts still present derive from many comparisons had with the actors of the F-Gas sector. I repeat: reducing greenhouse gases and looking for more sustainable and natural solutions in the refrigeration and heat pumps sector is our vision. The problem is the fundamentalism of some souls of this parliament. How is it possible to ask to eliminate F-Gas switching to more dangerous technologies such as flammable gases? Why do some want to impose prohibitions and deadlines too close if there are no technological solutions available? Fortunately, the Council reported balance with respect to the initial forecasts. It will be decisive to evaluate in the next mandate if this legislation will live up to the expectations of operators, actors and the environment. Two considerations. The first, in the European Union we are at the forefront in refrigeration; Do we want it to hurry ideological choices affect a sector of excellence? Do we not think that companies and workers need clear, clear, defending the environment without neglecting to defend their business? The second: we widen our gaze. Do you really think that with regulations so stringent and unrelated to the technological context will we be competitive in the international scenario? There are already quite quite aggressive commercial practices around us; How to support production and research of our companies if we do not create the suitable conditions? I conclude. There are a few months in the European elections, citizens ask us more and more to use reason and weighting in the choices, especially in those that touch everyday life. We therefore replace the various ideologies a pragmatic approach that protects, workers and our productions.",AGAINST,"Mr. President, honorable colleagues, I strongly believe in the importance of the Fluorinated gases regulation. The initial forecasts may have been ambitious, but that's exactly what we need - ambition to drive innovation and protect our environment. We cannot let the interests of the F-Gas sector hold us back from reducing greenhouse gases and finding more sustainable solutions. The use of flammable gases may be a necessary step towards a greener future, and we should not be afraid to take that step. We must prioritize the environment and the well-being of our citizens over the concerns of companies and workers. A pragmatic approach is not about being indecisive, but about being brave enough to make the tough choices. I urge you to support this regulation and show the world that we are committed to being a leader in environmental protection. Let us not be swayed by the fear of being less competitive in the international market, but instead, let us set an example for others to follow. We owe it to ourselves, our children, and the future of our planet."

The ozone layer is recovering in response to the Montreal protocol. Yet substances that affect the ozone layer and break down remains a great concern. Especially since they contribute so much to the climate crisis. Good steps are taken with this bill to tackle that. But we have to make much more work on replacing ozone -breaking gases that are used in production processes.

While the Montreal protocol is a great example of international cooperation, we must not forget that it was a gradual process. The ozone layer is recovering, but we should not jump to conclusions that all ozone-affecting substances can be replaced immediately. The use of these substances in production processes, such as plastic and pesticides, may not be ideal, but it is a reality that many industries rely on. Let us not jeopardize the livelihoods of people working in these industries without providing adequate alternatives and support. We should take a more measured approach to replacing these substances, rather than calling for an immediate stop."

Striving to join the European Community, they see the EU membership as a geostrategic investment in prosperity, stability and security based on common European values. Becoming part of the largest single market in the world opens doors for businesses to expand, innovate, invest and create new jobs. Recent rebooting of the enlargement policy after the aggression of Russia has a geopolitical logic. It will expand the democratic space on our continent and make it clear to Russia what is our preferred political order in Europe. But there are risks. The end of the war is unpredictable. We failed to isolate Russia globally, and we must spare no effort to avoid a decline of support for Ukraine. European enlargement has always been a ‘win-win’ situation for the Union and the newcomers. To ensure it this time, the EU must make its institutional and structural frameworks fit for purpose. The EU has committed to stand with Ukraine every step of the way towards the end of the war and the accession.

We must not forget that our primary focus should be on supporting Ukraine and avoiding a decline of support for them. Furthermore, the report states that the EU must make its institutional and structural frameworks fit for purpose, which is a significant undertaking that requires careful consideration and planning. Let us not prioritize the accession process over the well-being of our existing members and the stability of the region. We must spare no effort to ensure that our house is in order before inviting new members to join. History is indeed watching us, and we must not act hastily."
164582,"Mr. President, dear colleagues, there are times when an entire generation is called upon to demonstrate that she is up to the challenges of history we live one of these moments: an intense period of acceleration of The history which imposes a deep transformation of the Union at 27, the Union is not able to assume all its responsibilities, in particular in relation to the war and the new world disorder a union at 36, for lack of reform, Will be completely paralyzed we must reorganize our continent, and it is a transformation that must be tackled without totem or taboo, if we want to be credible and therefore influential and powerful. We must reform the Union in depth by revising the revision of the treaties, a reform of common policies, in particular agriculture and cohesion, and a budget reform. The choice available to us is clear: exporting our stability or importing the instability that is on our doors. But for this to be accepted and shared by our citizens, new resources are necessary. There is no other choice, no other way. Yes, dear colleagues, reform the union to unify the continent!",FOR,"Mr. President, dear colleagues, I understand the desire to reform the Union in light of future enlargement, but I strongly believe that we should not rush into deep transformations without careful consideration. The current Union at 27 is not perfect, but it has allowed us to maintain stability and unity. A Union at 36, with the right reforms, can indeed be more influential, but let us not forget the risks of paralysis that come with rapid expansion. Rather than revising the treaties and reforming common policies, we should focus on strengthening our existing institutions and ensuring that they are equipped to handle the challenges of enlargement. Importing new resources without a clear plan for their use can lead to inefficiencies and waste. Let us prioritize prudence and gradual reform over hasty and potentially destabilizing changes. We must not compromise the stability we have worked so hard to achieve. Let us proceed with caution and ensure that our citizens' interests are protected."
164582,"– Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues, yes, this report that was built with a big consensus between the political parties is also pointing out on the criteria that we need to apply when it comes to new membership candidates Yes, there’s also geostrategic reasons for us to speed up the candidacy process, but we, in this report, state very clearly that Copenhagen criteria have to be the basis of negotiation and of an accession process Also, we need to start to reward countries that have a full alignment with our security and foreign policy. We need to reward those that align, but we also need to set consequences for the ones that do not align, because we also have candidate applicants that are actively cooperating with China, that are actively aligning their security and foreign policy with Russia, that are backtracking on democratic standards like election law. There we need to be consequent and also withdraw funds from these countries, because otherwise the process of accession is not a trustworthy one, if you do not reward the ones that deliver. We need to look towards the East, and we need to look towards the new big candidate countries. First of all, the support for Ukraine needs to be uncontested and there is some additional work to do. Because unfortunately we cannot rely on the support that will be coming from the US: who knows how these presidential elections end. We need to take responsibility within the European Union, within our States, and support Ukraine to defend this illegal invasion into the country. That’s the first step and then we look into the candidate process.",FOR,"– Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues, while I understand the enthusiasm for deepening EU integration in view of future enlargement, I must express my reservations. We cannot afford to reward countries that have not fully aligned with our security and foreign policy. In fact, we should be cautious of countries that are actively cooperating with China and Russia, as this may compromise our values and interests. Moreover, withdrawing funds from these countries may not be the most effective approach, as it may push them further away from our orbit. Instead, we should focus on supporting Ukraine, but not at the expense of our own values and principles. We should also be mindful of our reliance on the US and not assume that their support will be unconditional. Let us proceed with caution and ensure that our enlargement process is based on a thorough assessment of the candidates' commitment to our values and principles."
164582,"– Mr President, saying that enlargement necessitates EU centralisation via treaty change is a blatant lie Such claim is factually wrong and biased, both politically and ideologically Enlargement is just a false pretext to build, as planned, a European superstate to replace the European Union of today. The ultimate proof of it is that planned reform proposes to preserve, not to eliminate, the veto on decision on enlargement. The vast scientific empirical research which has been analysing the impact of previous enlargements – from the early years until the last one – on the functioning of the EU institutions, proves that the enlargement had no negative effect on the decision-making capacity of the EU. It is also confirmed by the documents of the Council secretariat. On the contrary, empirical data prove that the speed of decision-making has actually increased. Moreover, various serious academic studies demonstrate that, after each enlargement, decision-making was faster when there were more Member States. Additionally, experts say that with a view to enlargement, you should decentralise, not further centralise. Centralising reform is not necessary thus, and would be counterproductive in that respect.",AGAINST,"Mr President, I disagree with the notion that centralising reform is counterproductive in view of future enlargement. In fact, the planned reform to preserve the veto on decision on enlargement is a necessary step to ensure the EU's decision-making capacity is not hindered. While it is true that empirical research shows that previous enlargements had no negative effect on the EU's decision-making capacity, it is also important to consider the unique challenges that future enlargements may bring. By centralising reform, we can ensure that the EU is better equipped to handle these challenges and make decisions more efficiently. Furthermore, experts may say that decentralisation is the way forward, but we must also consider the benefits of a more streamlined and cohesive EU decision-making process. Therefore, I believe that deepening EU integration via treaty change is a necessary step to ensure the EU's continued success and effectiveness."
164582,"Mr. President, dear colleagues, we discuss one last time before the European elections for the widening of the European Union, which you wish to extend to the Balkan countries to Georgia, via Moldova, Ukraine And even Turkey therefore allow me, too, one last time, to remember why we are firmly opposed it first, we do not want to revise the treaties, because you want to delete the rule of unanimity, and therefore delete the States' right of veto when it comes to joining a new country or not in the European Union. This goes against universal suffrage, against the will of the peoples and therefore of democracy, a value to which you are so attached when, obviously, it suits you. Second, we oppose these enlargements because they compromise the security of our nations and compatriots. How could we be reassured by integrating into Europe Albania and its mafia, Kosovo and its Islamist majority, Ukraine in the midst of war and which we know, on the other hand, its adhesion would sign the death of our French farmers, or Turkey who, with its 85 million inhabitants, would become the most populous country in Europe and threaten the balance of our civilization? Finally, this ideological obsession that you have to want to integrate what does not correspond to our roots and our values ​​would accentuate the migratory submersion which we know is at home, not a problem, but a project. Stop all this! It is a Europe of independent and sovereign nations that we claim. It is a Europe of free peoples whose speech is respected that we want. In this, we were completely opposed and, on June 9, we will give the floor to the peoples.",AGAINST,"Mr. President, dear colleagues, as we discuss the proposal of Deepening EU integration in view of future enlargement, I would like to emphasize the importance of revising the treaties to adapt to the changing European landscape. By deleting the rule of unanimity, we can facilitate the accession of new countries, such as Albania, Kosovo, Ukraine, and Turkey, which share our values and are committed to democracy. This will not only strengthen our union but also promote security and stability in the region. The integration of these countries will also bring new economic opportunities and cultural diversity, enriching our European civilization. Furthermore, by embracing our universal values, we can address the concerns of migratory submersion and promote a more inclusive and respectful Europe. Let us work together to build a Europe of unity, solidarity, and cooperation, where the voices of all nations are heard and respected."
164582,"Mr. President, dear colleagues, I find that we are going a little quickly in work I do not dispute, obviously, the usefulness of an in -depth debate on the institutional consequences of a hypothetical enlargement, but I ask the question: that Will the public opinion think of this eagerness to want to adapt Europe to the adhesion of eight new countries with 60 million inhabitants? This haste gives the impression that there is no more debate, that enlargement is made and that we have already moved on. But precisely, the expansion is debated and there are a number of reluctance among Europeans. First, from a social point of view; Integrating countries into so low wages can only worsen social dumping into Europe. There is also the question of the feasibility of enlargement. What will become, for example, agricultural policy, if we attach Ukraine? How will our farmers get out of it, who are already suffering from the abolition of customs duties on poultry and cereals? How can we finance this constant budget enlargement, knowing that new countries cannot afford to contribute? I find no serious answer to these legitimate questions, and I think that we do not do a service to the European project by pretending that these questions did not arise.",AGAINST,"Mr. President, dear colleagues, I strongly disagree with the notion that we are moving too quickly on deepening EU integration in view of future enlargement. On the contrary, I believe that our eagerness to adapt Europe to the adhesion of eight new countries with 60 million inhabitants demonstrates our commitment to a unified and inclusive Europe. The public opinion will see this as a positive step towards a more integrated Europe, rather than a sign that debate is being stifled. Furthermore, integrating countries with lower wages can actually bring new economic opportunities and stimulate growth, rather than worsening social dumping. As for the feasibility of enlargement, I believe that the challenges posed by agricultural policy and budget financing can be overcome through careful planning and negotiation. For example, we can work with Ukraine to develop a mutually beneficial agricultural policy that takes into account the needs of both our farmers and theirs. Additionally, the economic growth brought about by enlargement can actually increase the contributions of new member states to the EU budget. I believe that by addressing these questions head-on, we can strengthen the European project and create a brighter future for all Europeans."
164582,"– Madam President, Commissioner, colleagues – and indeed no Council, which is a shame What is EU enlargement about? At its core, it’s about improving people’s lives, about finishing the work that we started over 70 years ago: creating the large zone of democracy and rule of law on our continent It has been our most successful foreign policy instrument, and it became a geopolitical necessity now to protect ourselves and our neighbours against autocracy and continued instability But the EU itself needs to improve as well. It is up to us to make sure these two things go hand in hand in the interest of old and new citizens alike. We have an opportunity to turn the upcoming accession of countries into a win-win situation, strengthening and reforming our Union, while at the same time living up to our promises towards candidate countries. We have to ensure that the one process will not be hijacked by the other. We cannot have a situation that candidates have implemented all reforms, but we are not ready. Let’s unleash all creativity to reform and complete our Union as soon as possible. The citizens of Kyiv, Pristina and Tirana are Europeans. They want their democracies protected, want clean air, fair wages, freedom of choice, fundamental rights. They want a better life. Let us live up to the promise of Europe – for ourselves, for all Europeans.",FOR,"– Madam President, Commissioner, colleagues – while I agree that EU enlargement has been our most successful foreign policy instrument, I strongly believe that we must not rush into deepening EU integration in view of future enlargement. We risk creating a situation where the process of reforming our Union is hijacked by the accession of new countries. We must ensure that our own house is in order before we can effectively protect the democracies of candidate countries and provide them with the benefits of EU membership. Let us not make promises we cannot keep. The citizens of Kyiv, Pristina and Tirana deserve a stable and effective European Union, not a Union that is struggling to reform itself. Let us prioritize our own reforms and complete our Union before we take on new responsibilities."
164584,"Ms. President, dear Commissioner, valued colleagues! This week we will decide a new law on data exchange between online rental platforms and national authorities and I am looking forward to this for two very special reasons first: We solve a long known problem all of us know Airbnb and Co. Many people like to use them to accommodate To find or to rent yourself and this coexistence of private and commercial providers is now quite normal but - and that is the point here - everyone has to play according to the same rules and while there are strict requirements for commercial accommodation companies, the platform rental could often do not determine who rents where in whom and over and over what period. And that has become increasingly a problem that has become a big problem. And depending on the member country or region, the situation became more and more difficult to see. And now the rules are clear. Now the rules are uniform and we have free travel for transparency and fair competition. Secondly, I like this law because it is actually a very nice example of how laws are made in our internal market. The European Union creates a framework that gives the countries a solid database. And this basis serves as the basis for tailor -made laws on site - differently depending on the region or member country. This is how European Union goes. This is how subsidiarity goes. Please more of it! Many thanks to our rapporteur Kim van Sparrentak. Thank you for the good cooperation to all other colleagues.",FOR,"Ms. President, dear Commissioner, valued colleagues! While I understand the intention behind the proposed law on data exchange between online rental platforms and national authorities, I have to express my concerns. The uniform rules might stifle the diversity of regional approaches to regulating short-term accommodation rentals. By imposing a one-size-fits-all solution, we risk undermining the subsidiarity principle that this law is supposed to uphold. Moreover, the creation of a solid database for countries to build upon might lead to an over-reliance on EU frameworks, rather than encouraging innovative and tailored solutions at the regional or member country level. Let us not forget that the coexistence of private and commercial providers is what makes the short-term rental market thrive. We should be cautious not to overregulate and instead allow for more flexibility and regional autonomy. I urge you to reconsider the potential consequences of this law and strive for a more balanced approach."
164584,"Mrs. President, Commissioner Breton, honorable colleagues, the regulation on the collection and sharing of data relating to short -term housing rental services is an important new piece of the European mosaic I am happy to have followed it as a negotiator for the group of socialists and democrats Let me thank also immediately, however, the rapporteur, Kim Van Spartentak, for the extraordinary work done in recent months the online online rents platforms have stimulated the tourism economy but have also led to the so -called tourist tourist, by minute the livability and L 'Accessibility of accommodation. We cannot forget the university students who a few months ago in my country, in Italy, slept in the tent in the squares, manifesting against the dear-infamous for the officers. And this problem also concerns workers and families struggling with an out of control real estate market. Today some platforms do not comply with existing obligations and states move in scattered order. The legislative void precisely in short rents is a real problem. This regulation harmonizes the registration procedures between the online platforms and the competent authorities: it is not the definitive solution, but certainly it is a first fundamental step to give the Member States the tools necessary to legislate correctly. I am proud that all our priorities have been confirmed. They will receive a registration number. Online platforms will have to make sure that the information provided by the correct and, finally, the authorities will be able to act in the event of fraudulent use of the platform activities. In short, transparency and rules to make sure that, finally, political choices can then be made in a sector in continuous growth, that of short rents. The Europe we want, capable of imposing useful and effective rules even to those who have great power such as digital platforms, build step by step with choices like this.",FOR,"Mrs. President, Commissioner Breton, honorable colleagues, while I understand the concerns about the impact of short-term housing rental services on the livability and accessibility of accommodation, I believe this regulation may not be the solution we are looking for. As we acknowledge the importance of online platforms in stimulating the tourism economy, we must also recognize that over-regulation could stifle this growth. The proposed registration procedures and obligations on online platforms may lead to increased costs and administrative burdens, which could be passed on to consumers. Moreover, the regulation may not address the root causes of the problem, such as the lack of affordable housing, and instead may displace the issue to other areas. I agree that the legislative void in short-term rents is a problem, but I fear that this regulation may not provide the definitive solution we need. Let us not forget that some Member States have already implemented their own measures to address these issues, and we should be cautious not to create a one-size-fits-all approach that may not work for everyone. I urge my colleagues to consider the potential unintended consequences of this regulation and to think carefully about whether it is the right approach to address the challenges we face."
164584,"Dear President! Dear Mr Breton!

While I agree that short-term rental platforms can benefit Europeans, I believe that this Regulation goes too far in requiring clear data exchange and accessibility for our cities and municipalities. This could stifle free competition and create an undue burden on these platforms. Furthermore, harmonizing this legislation with the Digital Services Act may lead to a one-size-fits-all approach that neglects the unique needs of different Member States. Let us prioritize the interests of our citizens and the competitiveness of our digital economy by rejecting this proposal."

Properly regulated, they can provide accommodation for all who need it. Short-term lettings are making our housing crisis worse by taking homes off the market and they’re driving up prices and rents. Meanwhile, the Commission is delaying the introduction of a registration system in Ireland. Enough is enough! We have to provide solutions, not barriers to progress. The short-term regulation is progress. Sharing data is the future. We now need measures for more oversight of short-term rentals.",FOR,"– Madam President, Commissioner, while Europe does have a housing problem, we must be cautious not to create more barriers to progress. The Commission's delay in introducing a registration system in Ireland could be an opportunity to reassess the impact of regulation on short-term rentals. We have 13,000 people living in hotel bedrooms who could benefit from alternative accommodation options, and overly restrictive regulations could limit their choices. Furthermore, registration systems and data sharing requirements could lead to unintended consequences, such as driving short-term rentals underground, making them harder to regulate.

164584,"Mrs. President, Mr. Commissioner, Ladies Fellow, the accommodation rented for short periods represent about a quarter of the total of the tourist accommodation facilities in the European Union this is a phenomenon that has been characterized by a great expansion in recent years. But in many cases this expansion has been without rules and without controls, generating critical issues such as the exposure of consumers to safety risks, submerged work, tax evasion, unfair competition, the transformation of the economic and social fabric of ours city. Now the proper functioning of the European tourist ecosystem will be able to derive important benefits from this new regulation, thanks to a unique and simple series of information on information for the platforms and simplified registration procedures for landlords. The greatest transparency will strengthen the trust of travelers and help national and local authorities to develop better policies in the tourism sector, in order to ensure its social and environmental sustainability.",FOR,"Mrs. President, Mr. Commissioner, Ladies Fellow, while the expansion of short-term accommodation rental services has indeed brought about critical issues such as the exposure of consumers to safety risks, submerged work, tax evasion, unfair competition, and the transformation of the economic and social fabric of our cities, we must not overlook the potential negative consequences of overregulation. The proposed regulation, with its unique and simple series of information requirements for platforms and simplified registration procedures for landlords, may inadvertently stifle innovation and create unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles. Instead of promoting transparency and trust, we risk driving these services underground, ultimately undermining the social and environmental sustainability of our tourism sector. We must carefully weigh the benefits of regulation against the potential risks of overregulation and consider alternative solutions that balance the needs of all stakeholders."

The negotiations reported it to the original intent: a mapping of homes useful in the future to remodel the policies of short rents. There will also be greater transparency to protect consumers, often - the chronicles - victims of scams tell us. With registration it will be easier for consumers to understand who to contact in case of disservices. We are sure that this provision will help to increase consumer trust and to improve the short -term rents sector overall.",FOR,"Mrs. President, Signor Commissioner, Ladies Fellow, while it is true that 600 million nights are booked every year in short-term accommodation rentals, we must consider that this proposal may not be the solution to the problems it aims to address. In fact, it does not solve the problem of housing deficiencies in countries like Italy, which have a strong tourist vocation. Furthermore, the registration requirement may be seen as an additional burden on hosts, rather than a measure to increase transparency and protect consumers. We must be cautious not to create unnecessary bureaucracy that could harm the short-term rents sector, rather than improving it. We should focus on addressing the root causes of housing deficiencies, rather than just mapping homes."
164584,"Mrs. President, Dear Commissioners, especially Mrs. Newsletter, thank you very much for your work, because I think it is largely the result of your deployment that today we have a finished text I am glad that after years when the European Union housing area Ignored, we will vote tomorrow about the regulation of regulations at least what data have on-line platforms in the field of short-term leases such as Airbnb, sharing with cities is no secret that short-term lease often leads to raising housing prices and deteriorating quality of life in According to regulation, platforms will have to share detailed information about the apartments that are offered through them and will be responsible for their completeness and accuracy. The regulation will also facilitate the fight against illegally offered apartments. However, it is on the Member States themselves and cities themselves to use this regulation. It is only up to them whether they will introduce permit modes and whether they will request data from the platforms. And I firmly hope that the Czech Republic will take full advantage of this, because even the current insufficient regulation of short -term leases contributes to the fact that Prague is the most expensive city to housing throughout the European Union. There will be a chance to do something with the market for housing, so use it and stop just throwing people looking for housing, sticks under their feet unwillingness or fear of anger of platforms and speculators and preventing a chance to live well. I also firmly hope that the future European Commission will become more active in housing. The problem of unavailable housing applies to the whole of Europe and it is necessary to clearly start acting so that every person has the right to dignified housing and to be a place to live.",FOR,"Mrs. President, Dear Commissioners, I understand the concerns about the regulation of short-term accommodation rental services, but I must express my reservations about the proposed text. While I agree that the current lack of regulation contributes to rising housing prices and deteriorating quality of life, I fear that this regulation may not be the solution. By placing the responsibility on Member States and cities to introduce permit modes and request data from platforms, we risk creating a patchwork of different regulations across the EU, leading to confusion and inefficiency. Furthermore, I worry that the Czech Republic, which is already the most expensive city for housing in the EU, may misuse this regulation to further restrict the market, rather than addressing the root causes of the problem. I urge caution and careful consideration before implementing this regulation, and instead suggest that we focus on finding more comprehensive and effective solutions to the housing crisis that affects the whole of Europe."
166804,"– Mr President, Commissioner Simson, dear colleagues, it has been identified by the worldwide experts that cutting methane emissions is one of the most effective ways in order to reduce near-term global warming And according to my opinion, it is a quick win to tackle the climate crisis With the methane emissions reduction in the energy sector regulation, which we will vote on tomorrow, here in this House, we strike a balance and pave the way in order, first, to improve the accuracy of information on the main sources of methane emissions associated with energy consumed in the EU, second, to ensure further effective mitigation of methane emissions across the energy supply chain in the EU, third, to reduce methane emissions related to fossil energy imported to the EU without putting at stake our security of supply, which is also important and fourth, to avoid any additional cost to the end users, the consumers, SMEs and the industry. At the same time, with our report, with Parliament’s report, we give proper time to Member States to adapt and incentives to companies to invest in methane mitigation technologies as soon as feasible. This provision is another clear message to the citizens in reducing transmission, particularly in Poland, that the EU is ready to facilitate the acceleration of the energy transition without leaving anyone behind – and this is real solidarity. In my opinion, one of the key elements of this regulation is also to provide support to companies in order to achieve performance standards in an optimal manner while fully respecting the polluter pays principle. This is key to avoid too high cost for citizens. Commissioner, dear colleagues, by regulating methane emissions to the energy sector once again, the EU is taking the lead to tackle the climate crisis. We have to stick on our word. We initiated the Global Methane Pledge in Glasgow, binding ourselves to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030 compared with the level of 2020 and also involving all the relevant sectors, starting with energy, agriculture and waste management. It is now time to put this legislation into force as soon as possible.",FOR,"– Mr President, Commissioner Simson, dear colleagues, while I agree that cutting methane emissions is crucial in reducing near-term global warming, I strongly believe that the proposed regulation on methane emissions reduction in the energy sector may not be the most effective way to achieve this goal. By implementing this regulation, we risk putting our security of supply at stake, which is a concern that cannot be taken lightly. Furthermore, the provision to give proper time to Member States to adapt and incentives to companies to invest in methane mitigation technologies may lead to additional costs for citizens, SMEs, and the industry, which would be counterproductive. We must also consider the potential impact on countries like Poland, where the energy transition may be accelerated without adequate support. Instead of rushing to implement this regulation, we should focus on finding alternative solutions that balance our climate goals with the needs of our citizens and industries. Let us not forget that the polluter pays principle should not be used to justify excessive costs for citizens. We should take a more cautious approach and ensure that our actions are truly in the best interest of the EU and its citizens."
166804,"Mr President, Dear Ms. Commissioner Simson, dear colleagues! I am happy that five factions support the proposal in the morning. I believe that this proposal deserves this; Because this broad support has become possible because this proposal reaches two things: it is an ambitious start to push back the emission of a gas with considerable potential to endanger the climate, and it has been possible not to endanger jobs and economic activities. I want to make it clear using the example of the Polish mining, as the colleague Spyraki did. There are two guardrails on which this proposal is based: the one was not to endanger the already existing plan in Poland to deploy the mining. The social security for the Polish miners and the prevention of a social break, above all in the areas in the areas in Silesia, were particularly important to my faction, the social democratic faction To set game. As part of this plan, a reduction in methane emissions from the active shaft systems there is also to be reached. Yes, I am a little proud that I was able to contribute this proposal and of course received the support of the other shadow rapporteurs and the rapporteur himself. Dear colleagues, the social democratic faction supports the proposal for the methane regulation, and we will agree with him tomorrow.",FOR,"Mr President, Dear Ms. Commissioner Simson, dear colleagues! While I understand the desire to push back the emission of methane, a gas with considerable potential to endanger the climate, I fear that this proposal may not be as job-friendly as my colleagues claim. The Polish mining example, cited as a success story, is actually a cause for concern. The proposal's guardrails, meant to protect existing plans in Poland, may not be enough to prevent a social break in areas like Silesia. I worry that the reduction in methane emissions from active shaft systems, while a step in the right direction, may come at the cost of economic activities and jobs. I urge my colleagues to reconsider the potential consequences of this proposal and vote against it tomorrow."
166804,"Mr. President, Mrs. Commissioner, reducing methane emissions must be part of the solution of the climate crisis not only because we have committed ourselves to the methane challenge in Glasgow, but mainly because we damage our health, economy, energy security and last but not least climate Methane is 80 times worse climate gas than CO2. Today, in the production of fossil fuels used, the atmosphere is released or deliberately released a large number of methane. Routine release or leaks from neglected infrastructure are a normal thing. And the methane is actually the fossil gas that was so expensive last autumn, which we all saved, and we said how we will miss. All of this happened at a time when we were afraid of having something to heat. And actually, what is enough for us to tighten the taps, replace the valves. In order to, and in that legislation and in our comments, we have given space to innovation, gave space to new NATO technologies to be able to find out where the leaks are, detect them and repair them. Now the situation looks as if we let the water drip. And we have to stop it, because wasting is something that damages the planet, but also the wallets. The International Energy Agency, Scientists, Economists agree that we have relatively cheap tools in our hands that can prevent the average global temperature from increasing while contributing to our energy security. Methane emissions are exactly these tools. We must not forget that this problem is not only about Europe, and therefore I am glad that we are trying to influence emissions outside the European Union, which we, so to speak, import. And I believe that at the nearest climate conference we will also advance in the global tool to reduce methane emissions. Maybe we give him a price. Measures against methane leakage are both technologically and financially available. It would be a mistake not to use them.",FOR,"Mr. President, Mrs. Commissioner, I understand the concerns about methane emissions, but I urge caution in implementing strict regulations in the energy sector. As we all recall, last autumn we struggled with expensive fossil fuels and feared not having enough to heat our homes. Implementing new measures to reduce methane emissions could lead to increased costs, which would be passed on to consumers, exacerbating energy poverty. Furthermore, while the International Energy Agency, scientists, and economists agree that reducing methane emissions is crucial, we must not overlook the potential economic burden of implementing these measures. We should prioritize a balanced approach that takes into account both environmental concerns and economic realities. Perhaps we should focus on influencing emissions outside the European Union through global cooperation rather than imposing strict regulations on our own energy sector. Let us not forget that our actions have consequences, and we must ensure that our pursuit of environmental goals does not come at the expense of our economic security."
166804,"Mr. President! The greenhouse effect on the planet Earth has never increased as quickly as it does right now in recent weeks, the levels of carbon dioxide are about five million parts higher than a year since it is an increase rate that is in the order of twice as large as the one we had on average Over the past 10-20 years, the UN Climate Panel IPCC also writes very clearly in the latest report that now we also have to take power when it comes to emissions of methane methane is a much more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide is, especially on the short time scale, On the time scale that we have to make this whole change. This text that we will vote for tomorrow shows that we in Parliament can be much, much more ambitious than the Commission and the Member States have shown. We also know where the money is to be taken from, namely from the fossil industry. It would be enough to take 3 percent of their profits from the past year to get away from 80 percent in that sector. That's exactly what we have to make sure to do now.",FOR,"Mr. President! While the UN Climate Panel IPCC does highlight the importance of reducing methane emissions, we must be cautious not to overburden the energy sector with overly ambitious targets. The Commission and Member States have already proposed measures to address this issue, and we should not rush to exceed their proposals without careful consideration. Furthermore, imposing a 3% profit tax on the fossil industry may not be the most effective solution, as it could lead to unintended consequences such as job losses and economic instability. We should prioritize a more measured approach that balances our environmental goals with economic realities."
166804,"Mr. Chairman! Tomorrow we are voting over the regulation on the reduction of methane emissions, remember that the weight of this problem goes far beyond the framework of the EU climate policy for Upper Silesia, where I come from, which is also a litmus paper of the success of European green order, it is also a fundamental issue for economic and social reasons. That is why I thank the reporters and counterparts for a constructive dialogue. They were sometimes very difficult conversations, but also specific and substantive, stained not only for climate, but also about people and workplaces in mines. I am glad that we were able to find a compromise that we have already talked about here today, which gives more breath above all to Polish mines. I want to ask you to vote for accepting this text. Let's vote wisely, responsibly, in the spirit of EU Solidarity.",FOR,"Mr. Chairman! Tomorrow we are voting over the regulation on the reduction of methane emissions, I urge you to consider the potential consequences of the proposed compromise. While I understand the concerns about Polish mines, I believe that the economic and social benefits of reducing methane emissions far outweigh the costs. The compromise we have reached may give more breath to Polish mines, but it may also undermine the EU's climate policy and our commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. I ask you to vote against this text and instead strive for a more ambitious reduction in methane emissions, one that prioritizes the well-being of people and the planet over the interests of a single industry. Let's vote wisely, responsibly, in the spirit of EU Solidarity."
166804,"Mr. President, it was time for the European Union to focus on methane pollution while our institutions let off steam on motorists, responsible according to all the misfortunes in the world, methane pollution has remained under radars since Far too long, we are therefore in favor of certain measures, in particular to all those that protect the citizen from industrial leaks, but your bill poses a risk on our industries. While the invoices of our companies explode, the administrative constraints are always heavier and competition from third countries is more stifling than ever. In this text, you offer aberrant measures, it must be said. You want imports of essential materials, such as coal, gas, oil, to be affected by new legislation. Instead of helping European industry, you add new administrative constraints and new charges to sectors that are on the front line to ensure our energy autonomy. So, remember, our companies are by far the most virtuous in the world. Let us remind Europeans that before being polluting industries, they are indeed actors essential to the survival of our continent. Here is what is missing your text: more support and fewer constraints, much fewer constraints. Our strategic industries are at the end. If you do not act to protect them, they will eventually leave our continent.",AGAINST,"Mr. President, while I understand the concerns about the administrative constraints on our industries, I firmly believe that the Methane emissions reduction in the energy sector proposal is a necessary step towards a more sustainable future. As we all know, methane pollution has been under the radar for far too long, and it's time for us to take action. The measures proposed in this bill, such as protecting citizens from industrial leaks, are essential to ensuring the well-being of our people. Moreover, I'd like to remind my fellow parliamentarians that our companies, while being the most virtuous in the world, are also responsible for ensuring our energy autonomy. By implementing these measures, we can actually help our industries become more competitive in the long run by reducing their environmental impact. Let's not forget that our strategic industries are not just essential to the survival of our continent, but also to the future of our planet. Therefore, I propose that we focus on providing more support to our industries to adapt to these new measures, rather than watering them down. By doing so, we can ensure a sustainable future for our industries and for Europe as a whole."
166804,"– Mr President, firstly, we’d like to thank Jutta and her staff, and in particular Michelle, for all their work on the file The text we will vote on this week following the vote in the ENVI Committee is a very good one It’s far more ambitious than the Commission’s proposal Our main priority was to expand the scope to include imports, and we’re very pleased that the text now extends to imports of oil gas and coal Another priority was to introduce a methane performance standard, and we’re happy that the text now has a completely new provision tasking the Commission with introducing a mandatory performance standard via a delegated act. However, the text is disappointing in relation to coal: yet again, in behind closed doors negotiations, EPP propped up the far right. Yet again, EPP repeatedly parroted word for word the talking points of the fossil fuel industry and the lobbyists. I hope the EPP’s cosy relationship with the fossil fuel industry is a matter of concern for the Irish MEPs in the EPP.",FOR,"Mr President, while we acknowledge the efforts of Jutta and her staff, we cannot support the text as it stands. The expansion of the scope to include imports of oil, gas, and coal may be overly ambitious and could have unintended consequences on our economy. Furthermore, the introduction of a methane performance standard via a delegated act may give too much power to the Commission. We also note that the text is not perfect, particularly in relation to coal, where it seems that concessions were made to the fossil fuel industry. However, we should not dismiss the progress made and instead work towards finding a more balanced approach that takes into account the concerns of all stakeholders, including the industry and the Irish MEPs in the EPP."
168862,"Mr. President, the Commissioner, Hungary is once again in the plenary of the Parliament Yes, once again in the plenary of Parliament unfortunately, this is the whole problem the Hungarian government does not accept to see its offenses at the 'PROGRAM, does not accept union criticisms and does not want to amend the measures taken are manifestly simply to throw powder in the eyes, so they are not effective and do not produce the expected effects . This is the case for the integrity authority set up by the Hungarian government to meet the commission's requests. This authority does not have the powers of carrying out its anti -corruption missions. The Commission must therefore pay very attention to the expenses it imposes on Hungary in the domain of the rule of law. It is absolutely not enough to demand that means be put in place. It is not enough to require measures, require results. And it is the results that Hungary must be measured, also in the case of the integrity authority. Also, apart from all the laws of law already existing, among other things of corruption and independence of justice, is added today the creation of a defense authority of sovereignty, which allows The Hungarian state to use a law called ""foreign anti-influence"" to in fact gag any opposition to the government. This is the typical case of diversion of a law at the start of European inspiration, but used in ""Russian"" fashion which, instead of protecting citizens and democracy, is transformed into an intimidation law to prevent the Civil society, journalists and politicians to express their opposition to power. The Commission has also justly launched a procedure against Hungary following the implementation of this law. Finally, I would like to note that the Council did not play its role in what looks at the article seven and also raised once again the difficult situation in which the European Union will be at the time when Hungary will assume the presidency of the Union on July 1ᵉʳ, at a crucial time for the European Union, the day after the elections and at the time of the constitution of a new commission. In this Parliament, we had asked the council to take responsibility and to consider postponing this Hungarian presidency to a later time. It was not done. The 26 must now be particularly vigilant.",AGAINST,"Mr. President, I understand the concerns raised about Hungary's commitment to the rule of law, but I believe we must recognize the efforts made by the Hungarian government to address these concerns. The establishment of an integrity authority, although imperfect, is a step in the right direction. We should encourage and support Hungary in its efforts to strengthen the rule of law, rather than simply criticizing its measures as ineffective. Moreover, the 'foreign anti-influence' law, although problematic, was enacted with the intention of protecting Hungarian sovereignty. We must be cautious not to overstep our bounds and respect the autonomy of EU member states. Furthermore, I believe the Council's decision not to postpone Hungary's presidency is a vote of confidence in the country's ability to uphold EU values. We must work together to support Hungary in its presidency and ensure a successful transition. Let us focus on constructive dialogue and cooperation, rather than condemnation and criticism."

The fact that Viktor Orbán still votes in the European Council is actually a shame, given the democratic demolition. Just like the fact that the European Commission decided to release billions to Budapest without the reason being. An error for which we drag the committee to court. I say to all Hungarians: we stand next to you and we will continue to do that.",FOR,"Chairman, colleagues, committee, I understand the concerns about Hungary's recent developments, but I believe we should not rush to judgment. We have a task to protect democracy in Hungary through the Article 7 procedure, but we must also acknowledge that Hungary is still a member of our democratic union. Viktor Orbán's government has indeed taken actions that we disagree with, such as suppressing LGBTI people and limiting the independence of judges and journalists. However, we must also recognize that the European Commission has decided to release billions to Budapest, and we should respect their decision-making process. Instead of taking a confrontational approach, I propose that we work with Hungary to address our concerns and find a solution that strengthens the rule of law and its budgetary implications. We should not drag the committee to court, but rather engage in constructive dialogue. Let us stand together with Hungary and work towards a common goal of upholding democracy and the rule of law in our union."
168862,"Dear President! My fellow Members! The rule of law against Hungary began with good purposes not to steal EU funds, but to spend on what they were intended for, but we see that the rule of law is important for the development of Hungary and the support of the Hungarian people is not enough to ensure it In a normal country, the prosecutor's office would bring those who steal these EU funds, but in Hungary there are no normal conditions in Hungary for 14 years, for example, according Money is not safe, so I ask the committee to support our joint proposal with my colleague Katalin Cseh and set a condition to join the European Prosecutor's Office, as this can only ensure that the EU money coming to Hungary is indeed a good for the Hungarian people , and not Viktor Orban's economic circle is enriched",FOR,"Dear President! My fellow Members! I understand the concerns about the rule of law in Hungary, but I strongly believe that setting a condition to join the European Prosecutor's Office is not the right approach. The Hungarian people have shown their support for the development of their country, and we should trust them to ensure that EU funds are spent for their intended purposes. In fact, Hungary has been a member of the EU for 14 years, and it's time we start treating it as a normal country, rather than imposing additional conditions. Let's not enrich the bureaucracy of the European Prosecutor's Office, but rather let the Hungarian people benefit from the EU funds directly."

What is the real state of democracy in Hungary? How can the next European, national and local elections be held safely in Hungary under these conditions?",AGAINST,"– Mr President, I understand the concerns about the recent law in Hungary, but I believe we should not rush to judgment. The Hungarian Government has stated that the law is intended to protect national sovereignty, which is a fundamental right of any nation. We should respect Hungary's efforts to safeguard its sovereignty and not assume the worst. The notion of sovereignty may be broad, but it is not inherently vague. It is up to the Hungarian courts to interpret the law and ensure it is applied fairly. We should also consider the potential benefits of this law, such as protecting Hungary's national interests and promoting a sense of national unity. Rather than jumping to conclusions, we should engage in constructive dialogue with the Hungarian Government to understand their intentions and work together to find solutions that strengthen the rule of law and democracy in Hungary."
168862,"Mr. President, my dear ladies and gentlemen! One already has the impression that large parts of the house are arrested in a very absurd and distant reality, the only offense that the Hungarians have really committed: in a majority of the population of a person to have expressed confidence that does not do this, What a left majority of the house wants here, namely Viktor Orbán yes, he does not take part in the left migration madness. Yes, he is also one who pronounces peace like the Pope, and not a war driver like a majority here in the house. These are the offenses, nothing else. The Hungarians can only apologize for what a majority of this house does to the people of the Hungarians to argue with a way here that is not acceptable. For example, they rode the attack against Hungary that there is corruption here - in the same breathing second as the commission president is investigating the European public prosecutor because of 35 billion euros. How absurd can you be, how hypocritical can you be? I can only appeal to you to meet the Hungarian with respect, and if the upcoming choice is that the Hungarians have more friends here again than it is.",AGAINST,"Mr. President, my dear colleagues, I strongly disagree with the notion that Hungary has been unfairly targeted by this house. The fact that Viktor Orbán's government has expressed views on migration that differ from the majority of this house does not justify the erosion of the rule of law in Hungary. Furthermore, the issue at hand is not about left or right, but about the fundamental values of the European Union. Corruption is a serious concern, and it is hypocritical to deflect criticism by pointing to the European public prosecutor's investigation. The fact remains that Hungary's government has been accused of corruption, and it is our duty to ensure that EU funds are not misused. I urge you to support this resolution and uphold the rule of law in Hungary, rather than turning a blind eye to its shortcomings."

By allowing previously withheld funds to be paid, we are directly benefiting the citizens of Hungary. Taking away Hungary's voting rights would be an extreme measure that could further polarize the situation. Instead, let us continue to engage in constructive dialogue and support the Hungarian people through our financial assistance. This approach will ultimately strengthen the rule of law and promote European values in Hungary."
168054,"Mr. President, Madam Commissioner, Dear colleagues, the right to a safe and legal abortion is a necessity and a question of public health while we build Europe of health here, in this parliament, this parliament of which Simone Veil was the president, while we legislate to allow all European citizens an equal access to care, a woman dies every nine minutes of a clandestine abortion, however, you must have a speech of truth and stop deceiving citizens . Emmanuel Macron promises to include the right to abortion in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and thus wishes to position himself as the great defender of women's rights in Europe. The registration of the right to abortion in the charter is certainly a great intention, to which I fully subscribe, but what Emmanuel Macron does not say is that it is, today, technically impossible. Impossible, because it is not a European competence. Impossible, because the charter of fundamental rights having the value of a treaty, it is necessary, to modify, the unanimity of the governments of the Member States. And, contrary to what you are suggested, to register the right to abortion in the Charter, it is not enough for a simple majority vote in the European Parliament, all the governments of the 27 Member States must Unanimously agree. In other words, the refusal of a single state makes this inscription in the charter impossible. However, as we know, many states still slow down four irons on this issue. I think of Malta, Poland, Hungary. Mr. Macron, the European electoral campaign should not make our Parliament a theater where a comedy of Europe is played out. Let us not ment to citizens on what can really be done at European level. Let's be honest. The action of the European Union has its limits, those imposed by the treaties. Let's be frank. If Emmanuel Macron had really wanted to defend the rights of women, he would not have vetoed the inclusion of rape in the very first European law to combat violence against women. And, in this regard, his latest statements are unlikely and irresponsible. And then let's be transparent. The right to abortion? Yes. But what about when, in our own territory, in France, support structures and doctors are lacking, when women cannot have access to care, required care services? Are it not the urgency and priority of Mr. Macron? You have to stop making a diversion. A few weeks before the European elections, women deserve much better than that.",AGAINST,"Mr. President, Madam Commissioner, Dear colleagues, while I understand the concerns raised about the technical difficulties of including the right to abortion in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, I firmly believe that this should not deter us from taking a strong stance on this matter. We must not let the unanimity requirement of the Member States hold us back from advocating for the rights of women across Europe. The fact that many states, such as Malta, Poland, and Hungary, may resist this move should only strengthen our resolve to push for progress. We must remember that the European Union is not just a collection of individual states, but a community that shares common values and principles. The right to a safe and legal abortion is a fundamental aspect of women's health and well-being, and it is our duty to protect and promote it. I agree that support structures and doctors are lacking in some areas, including France, but this is all the more reason to take action at the European level to address these shortcomings. Rather than being a diversion, the inclusion of the right to abortion in the Charter would be a powerful statement of our commitment to women's rights and a call to action for Member States to improve their healthcare systems. Let us not be deterred by the challenges ahead, but instead work together to create a Europe where all women have access to the care and services they need."

The hell of women undergoes a barbaric anti -abortion prohibition in Poland, in Malta in many countries it is also tried to limit women's rights, of course, this initiative of the Renew group is extremely important, I only appeal here that colleagues and colleagues from the same group in Poland heard your voice, because it is this one The group in Poland blocks the mines of good changes for a good law that allows women to decide about their lives and health, the ban on abortion has their real repercussions, but discrimination against women and girls, unfortunately, also continues in many other fields: in the economic, social and cultural sphere, when it comes to Global challenges, which is why we need the European Card of Women's Rights. I appeal to the European Commission to start work on this important document in the next term. It cannot be that in 2024 in the European Union we have standards in many different fields, and we still do not have one standard when it comes to women's rights. We have to change it.",FOR,"Mr. Chairman, while I understand the concerns about women's rights in certain EU countries, I must express my reservations about the proposal to include the right to abortion in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. The same group that proposes this initiative is also responsible for blocking good changes in Poland, which raises questions about their commitment to finding a balanced solution. Moreover, we must acknowledge that the EU already has different standards in many fields, and imposing a uniform standard on women's rights might not be the most effective approach. Instead of rushing into this, I suggest we focus on supporting the European Commission in developing the European Card of Women's Rights, which could provide a more comprehensive framework for addressing the various challenges women face in the economic, social, and cultural sphere."

Abortion should be a question that is decided between a woman and her doctor. And healthcare is a European issue when it suits the Member States. So that’s why I regret that the Council is not here today, because the Member States should unite in a coalition for the women of Europe, because we should provide full healthcare to all women. For the women of Malta, ‘’. We see you. We are with you. We need abortion as a right for all women. We need access to medical abortion across borders. I ask for right to abortion to be enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, but also for the Member States to take action and provide healthcare to women in Europe for abortion in their Member States, in excess of what is required by the European Union.",FOR,"– Mr President, while I understand the sentiment behind the proposal to include the right to abortion in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, I must express my reservations. If healthcare is a European issue, then it is precisely because it should be addressed at the European level with the involvement of all Member States, including those with differing views on abortion. The Council's absence today is a reminder that this is not a decision to be taken lightly or unilaterally. We risk creating a division among Member States and undermining the unity we strive for. Furthermore, if we are to provide full healthcare to all women, we must also consider the complexities and nuances of this issue, rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all solution. I urge caution and a more comprehensive approach, rather than rushing to enshrine the right to abortion in the Charter without the consensus of all Member States."
168054,"– Mr President, it is time for feminists, for progressives and for citizens to ask for what is needed And in 2024, enshrining sexual and reproductive rights in the heart of our European text is a necessity for the well-being of people and specifically the safety of women There is no healthy democracy without women’s rights and gender equality Last November, this Parliament voted to have the inclusion of these rights in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and it is good to reaffirm it today But why be less ambitious? We have to reclaim the entirety of our rights and to counter the narrative of the far right and those who want to make us live in fear. Bodily autonomy comes with contraception. Bodily autonomy comes with sexual education. The health of women can no longer be less of a priority for academics and doctors. Ignorance has always been a poison used to control a population. Of course we need abortion. Abortion gives women the power to choose their own lives. This is not a discussion. There are still too many women at risk of dying, or having to flee their country to find a solution, or seeing their life dramatically impacted by an unwanted pregnancy in the European Union. Yes! But this is a societal and democratic issue, not a woman’s problem. All people, no matter what their sex and gender, should know their body. So this is how to protect it. How to heal it. The nature of desire. What is consent? This is what we need. We need full and universal access to sexual and reproductive health and rights without discrimination, including, indeed, access to safe and legal abortion.",FOR,"Mr. President, while I understand the concerns for women's rights and gender equality, I must express my reservations about including the right to abortion in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. The fact that this Parliament voted for its inclusion last November does not necessarily mean it is the right decision. We should be cautious not to be overly ambitious and impose our will on member states with differing cultural and moral values. Bodily autonomy is indeed important, but it should not come at the expense of the unborn. The health of women is a priority, but so is the preservation of life. We should focus on providing better access to contraception and sexual education, rather than resorting to abortion. Let us not forget that there are still many women who are against abortion and we should respect their rights and opinions as well. This is not just a societal and democratic issue, but also a moral one that requires careful consideration and respect for differing views. We should strive for a more nuanced approach that balances the rights of women with the rights of the unborn, rather than making sweeping declarations that may have unintended consequences."

Let's stop seeing motherhood as a threat. Let's appreciate life. We know that no mother regrets it. The abortion option leaves us lying. It is not a health service, it is the attention of pregnancy and childhood. The woman who feels welcome, dear, does not deny life and can receive her with hope.",AGAINST,"Mr. President, Mrs. Commissioner, Ladies, we must recognize that the proposal to include the right to abortion in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is a necessary step to ensure the freedom and autonomy of women. By acknowledging the complexity of circumstances that lead women to consider abortion, such as poverty, loneliness, and fear of not being accepted, we must provide them with the support and resources they need to make a truly free and conscious decision. This includes access to safe and legal abortion services. Let's not see motherhood as a forced destiny, but as a choice that women can make with dignity. The abortion option is not a lie, but a necessary health service that allows women to take control of their lives and their bodies.

The half inks are over. The right to abortion must be incorporated into the Charter of Fundamental Rights as an autonomous right linked to life and dignity. And states have to constitutionalize it. There is the notice to navigators of the European Court of Human Rights with the anti -abortion policies of Poland. By Izabela, by Dorota, by Justyna, for Andrea, for Antonia.

While some argue that the right to abortion is essential for women's dignity and life, we must also recognize that this right is not universally accepted and is often subject to state health competences. In fact, the strong defense of the life of the unborn is rooted in the conventional family values that many EU citizens hold dear. We must be cautious not to impose a one-size-fits-all solution that disregards these values. Instead, we should respect the diversity of opinions and the role of member states in regulating this sensitive issue.

168442,"Ms. President, Ms. Commissioner, values ​​and colleagues, dear rapporteur! More than half of the victims of human trafficking in the EU are EU citizens-victims in their own country, at the same time, has increased the number of non-EU citizens in recent years. In some places, the figures of domestic or domestic victims have already exceeded the majority of the victims If women and girls are the goal: sexual exploitation The proportion of male victims, mainly for the purpose of work exploitation, also takes about every fourth victim a child is most human dealers in the EU are EU citizens almost three quarters of the perpetrators are men of Last European report on the most dangerous criminal networks in the EU lists 55 of these networks alone, whose main activity of human trafficking is the boundaries between legal corporate structures as camouflage and illegal business is increasingly blurred human trafficking and remains one of the most stable and lucrative crime phenomena in the EU . Unfortunately, the previous guideline for the fight against human trafficking from 2001 has not changed anything. Why? For two simple, but all the more frustrating reasons: First: So far, it has not been implemented or only insufficiently implemented by the majority of Member States. Secondly, the crime area, not least through the Internet, has developed decisively. The new version therefore focuses precisely on giving criminal investigation and law enforcement authorities more instruments in order to take a look Knowingly from victims, to improve, to counter the cynical possibilities of the online dimension more consistently and to improve the proceedings for early identification and support of the victims. The almost important point-I find-to strengthen cooperation between all European bodies, such as the coordinators, Europol, Frontex, on the one hand and the national coordination, investigative and law enforcement authorities on the other. For this, the colleagues, the entire team who worked on it, thank you very much. But, dear colleagues, this can only lead to success if the member states also implement and apply the instruments. This applies to the present guideline, this applies to the improved police information exchange, the strengthened fight against money laundering or the use of AI. We will only arrive against this inhuman business if our law enforcement and investigative authorities have all the instruments that you need to fulfill your task.",FOR,"Ms. President, Ms. Commissioner, values ​​and colleagues, dear rapporteur! While I understand the concerns about human trafficking, I believe the new proposal does not adequately address the root causes of this issue. The previous guideline from 2001 may not have been implemented or only insufficiently implemented by the majority of Member States, but simply giving more instruments to criminal investigation and law enforcement authorities may not be the solution. The Internet has indeed changed the landscape of human trafficking, but we must be cautious not to overstep our boundaries and compromise individual freedoms. Furthermore, the proposal's focus on strengthening cooperation between European bodies may lead to unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles and inefficiencies. We must prioritize a more nuanced approach that addresses the complexities of human trafficking, rather than relying solely on increased law enforcement powers. Let us not forget that the majority of human traffickers are EU citizens, and we must examine our own societal structures that enable such crimes to occur. I urge my colleagues to reconsider this proposal and work towards a more comprehensive and effective solution."

Therefore, we are facing a brutal landscape that we have to undertake. The Report on the implementation shows defects in the protection of victims, defects in the coordination of national authorities, shortage of demands, shortage of complaints and, therefore, the need to undertake the demand for labor and sexual services. That is the essential point of this legislation: invite member states to criminally typify the use of labor or sexual services of trafficking victims, in addition to criminally typing forced marriage, illegal adoption, organ extraction and, of course , the exploitation of subrogated pregnancy. It is an advance of European legislation, a criminal directive against the illicit traffic that gives a clear mandate of commitment of the European legislator against this unbearable form of exploitation of people such as illicit traffic and trafficking in human beings.",FOR,"Madam President, commissioner Johansson, while I understand the concerns about human trafficking, I have to express my reservations about the proposed legislation. We must acknowledge that the current European legislation against trafficking has been in place for over a decade, and yet we still see thousands of people falling victim to exploitation every year. 70% of these victims are women, and 70% of them are victims of sexual exploitation. However, instead of introducing new laws, we should focus on improving the implementation and coordination of our existing laws. The report on the implementation shows defects in the protection of victims and the coordination of national authorities, which suggests that our efforts should be directed towards addressing these shortcomings rather than expanding the scope of criminal law. Furthermore, the proposed legislation's focus on criminally typifying the use of labor or sexual services of trafficking victims may not be the most effective way to tackle the root causes of human trafficking. We should prioritize supporting victims and preventing trafficking from occurring in the first place, rather than solely relying on punitive measures."
168442,"– Madam President, in January, when we were already heavily negotiating on the directive, an article was published in the local Brussels newspaper It was the story of Ernestine, an undocumented migrant who left her home country to flee from domestic violence Ernestine was offered a place to stay in exchange for childcare without any proper pay In fact, her so-called employer started demanding that Ernestine contribute to bills and rent When she reached out to help, she was recruited to work at a vegetable shop for EUR 2 per hour Her employer would demand rent money from her because he let her sleep in the corner of the shop, that way he kept her indebted This is not far away from home, this is in Brussels Ernestine and many vulnerable persons are being recruited in order to be exploited and tricked into cheap labour. The update of this directive takes more measures to protect victims by introducing early detection and specialised assistance. It also provides for more opportunities to persecute perpetrators by introducing measures for legal persons, aggravating circumstances and punishment for those who knowingly use services from trafficked persons. Trafficking is not only the crime, it is a blatant violation of human rights.",FOR,"– Madam President, I understand the story of Ernestine, an undocumented migrant who was exploited in Brussels, is heartbreaking. However, we must not let emotions cloud our judgment on the update of this directive. While the intention to protect victims by introducing early detection and specialised assistance is commendable, we must consider the unintended consequences. By introducing measures for legal persons and aggravating circumstances, we risk overburdening our already strained judicial system. Furthermore, the punishment for those who knowingly use services from trafficked persons may lead to a culture of fear, where people are reluctant to report suspicious activities. We must ensure that our efforts to combat trafficking do not inadvertently harm the very people we are trying to protect. Let us not rush into this update without careful consideration of its potential impact."
168442,"Mrs. Speaker! I am so grateful for all the women, the survivors, who during the work with this legislation have shared their terrible experiences and experiences you have repeated that you do it to save others - save those who are still in it Hell that you have managed to get away from it is thanks to your and others' courage, strength and solidarity that we now get tougher legislation in place throughout the EU. It will make it more difficult for those who want to buy other people's slave labor, and it will make it easier for the victims to get help. And to you who are pondering the demand for trafficking victims when you buy sex, every time you buy sex: You are a shame for humanity.",FOR,"Mrs. Speaker, while I understand the intention behind this legislation, I must express my concerns that it may inadvertently drive the demand for trafficking victims further underground, making it even more challenging for victims to seek help. Instead of shaming those who buy sex, we should focus on addressing the root causes of demand and providing support for those who are struggling with their choices. We must prioritize a more nuanced approach that balances punishment with compassion and understanding."
168442,"Mrs. President, Mrs. curator, ladies, thanks to the speakers for matching so many visions, the traffic of people is essentially a perversion of the value of life and, therefore, the dignity of the person. No one deserves to be treated as an object, much less, as an object of transaction. We are all an end in themselves, and not goods or useful for others to dishonor our identity. From a culture that denigrates the value of human life, we can expect practices that threaten immoral and criminally against people, try women and children who must be investigated and persecuted. Subrogated gestation is also a mode of exploitation, where some profit from the despair of others with proposals that manipulate the will of the parties involved, to which it is tempted with exits that - you are released - chained them in great dilemmas and wishes Always dissatisfied. It cannot be otherwise. The baby is offered as a design object, susceptible to even be rejected. Women catches perverse contracts that ignore their freedom and health and promote the acceptance of traumatic tear that involves the separation of a mother from her son. Hopefully this change in the directive related to the prevention and fight against human trafficking prevents these practices that damage us in the depths of the human heart.",FOR,"Mrs. President, while I understand the concerns raised by my fellow speaker, I must express my reservations about the proposal to prevent and combat trafficking in human beings. The directive, as it stands, may inadvertently infringe upon the freedom and autonomy of women who engage in surrogacy arrangements. By labeling these arrangements as a form of exploitation, we risk stigmatizing women who make informed choices about their bodies and reproductive health. Furthermore, the proposal's focus on the exploitation of women and children may overlook the complexities of the issue, where some individuals may be willing participants in these arrangements. We must be cautious not to conflate exploitation with consent, lest we create a culture of paternalism that undermines the agency of individuals. Instead, I propose that we adopt a more nuanced approach that balances the need to protect vulnerable individuals with the need to respect the autonomy of all individuals involved."
168442,"President, in 2024, human trafficking continues to affect thousands of people worldwide alone in 2021, the European Union recorded more than 7,000 victims between 2008 and 2022, Portugal recorded an increase of 107 % in this type of crime. Unfortunately, in Alentejo, those who work the land are, for the most part, migrant citizens from countries such as Nepal, Bangladexe, Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova, Ukraine, India, Senegal, Pakistan, Timor-Leste-and could say others- attracted to Europe under false promises of criminal networks. Upon arrival, instead of worthy work, they are manipulated by employers who seize passports to them, keep them in remote places, with unhealthy conditions and more debt than salary. Of the 24.9 million people, of which the ILO speaks, which are trapped in forced labor, 16 million are explored in the private sector, such as domestic work, such as construction or agriculture. There is an EU political responsibility against trafficking, for better solidarity, investment in the ability to welcome and integrate safe roads for immigrants and refugees, rather than insisting on insurance measures that always leave them in the hands of these unscrupulous people and without work worthy.",FOR,"President, while I understand the concerns about human trafficking, I must express my reservations about the proposed measures. We must acknowledge that increased investment in welcoming and integrating immigrants and refugees could lead to unintended consequences, such as encouraging more people to make the perilous journey to Europe. Furthermore, the 107% increase in human trafficking in Portugal between 2008 and 2022 suggests that our current measures are not effective. Instead of pouring more resources into these efforts, we should focus on strengthening our existing laws and enforcement mechanisms to prevent traffickers from exploiting vulnerable individuals. The fact that 16 million people are exploited in the private sector, including domestic work, construction, and agriculture, highlights the need for more targeted and effective solutions rather than blanket measures. We must prioritize the safety and security of our citizens and ensure that our policies do not inadvertently enable the very crimes we seek to prevent."
168589,"– Madam President, Commissioner, we all agreed that the current Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) is outdated and is not compatible with the EU Green Deal objectives, and that is why the EPP has always supported the EU collective exit from the ECT, but linked to the modernisation of the treaty Unfortunately, two years ago, political conditions for the ECT modernisation at the Council and at the EP level did not exist. Now, the new approach proposed by the European Commission opens the possibility for the EU to withdraw from the ECT. Parliament is expected to give its consent for the Council decision on the withdrawal and the EPP is supportive of the withdrawal decision of the Council. For the modernisation to take place during the November ECT Conference, Member States wishing to stay in the ECT should not prevent its modernisation. We expect the Council to accept this approach and hope that this agreement regarding the authorisation procedure will not become a stumbling block for those states that would like to remain members of the modernised treaty. We also understand that the Commission and the Council will take into account the fact that after the notification of the withdrawal, the EU will have only one year of grace period. We also expect to be informed as soon as possible about the  agreement.",FOR,"– Madam President, Commissioner, while the EPP supports the EU collective exit from the Energy Charter Treaty, I believe we should reconsider our approach. Two years ago, the conditions for the ECT modernisation were not ripe, but that does not necessarily mean that withdrawal is the best course of action now. Instead of withdrawing, we should focus on working with Member States to modernise the treaty during the November ECT Conference. We should not prevent those states that wish to stay in the ECT from doing so, and we should not rush into a decision that could have unintended consequences. Let us not forget that after the notification of the withdrawal, the EU will have only one year of grace period. I urge the Council to carefully consider the implications of withdrawal and to explore alternative solutions that would allow us to achieve our EU Green Deal objectives without abandoning the ECT altogether."
168589,"Madam President, Mrs. Commissioner, we face elections within nothing, as we all know the most important thing is to offer citizens security and coherence, and to offer them security and coherence we have to defend the objective principles of the ecological transition and the Fight against climate change and I agree with what she has said, Mrs. curator: staying in the treaty is not an option. My political group has always defended the modernization of the treaty if it met each and every one of the requirements we requested. I recognize the efforts and my group recognizes the efforts made by the commission in modernization, but they have not been enough. Obviously, within fifty -three contracting parts not all share the ambitions of the union to combat climate change. We already knew it, and in the resolution of this Parliament of 2022 we said clearly. It is essential to get tomorrow a massive vote not to maintenance in this treaty; No to an investment protection system based on private arbitration that allows investors to demand governments for the elimination of fossil fuels. Today there are 3,000 million usd pending in litigation against governments for this reason and we have to say no to obstacles to the fight against climate change, something that is absolutely incompatible with the objectives of Paris. That is why we believe that it is essential to give tomorrow a high and clear message that we are coherent, that we defend what we say and what we propose, and that this exit from the Treaty of the Union will be effective. And another thing that I ask, in this case to the Council, is that it allows intra -community claims to cease to take place by virtue of that treaty and go where they must go, which is to the courts of justice of the Union.",AGAINST,"Madam President, Mrs. Commissioner, I understand the concerns raised about the Energy Charter Treaty, but I strongly believe that withdrawing from it is not the solution. The Commission has made efforts to modernize the treaty, and while it may not meet all our requirements, it is a step in the right direction. We should continue to work with the other 53 contracting parties to address our concerns, rather than abandoning the treaty altogether. Moreover, the investment protection system based on private arbitration has its benefits, and we should not dismiss it outright. Instead, we should focus on reforming it to make it more compatible with our climate goals. Let us not forget that the treaty also provides a framework for cooperation and dispute resolution, which is essential for a unified EU energy policy.

Rightly and under our pressure, they came out individually from this obsolete treaty. We cannot accept that one of our Member States is attacked by foreign powers or entities that place their economic interests before our objectives of independence and carbon neutrality.

Thus, we will definitively pass from speech to acts, speeches to the concrete defense of our European ambitions and interests. It is more than time.",FOR,"Madam President, Madam Commissioner, while I understand the imperative necessity of getting out of fossil fuels, I strongly believe that withdrawing from the Energy Charter Treaty is not the solution. In fact, several of our Member States have already made the choice to exit the treaty individually, which raises concerns about the potential economic consequences and the impact on our energy sovereignty. If we withdraw from the treaty as a Union, we risk being attacked by foreign powers or entities that will place their economic interests before our objectives of independence and carbon neutrality. Furthermore, a coordinated exit may undermine the security and prosperity of Europeans, which are common challenges that we must address.

168589,"The Mr President, the fact that we now decide to resign as a European Union, tells how far we have come in climate action This agreement has been the only things that fossil companies have left when they have been desperately trying to slow down European transformation towards carbon neutral and clean energy. In recent years, we have launched hundreds of billion, if not thousands of billions of euros, to invest in pure energy and clean green. It can be said that, according to the International Energy Organization, the green transition from Europe has created thirty percent of Europe's growth in recent years, compared with 10 % of economic growth in global green growth. So this is the thing we have progressed and the fact that we now resign from this fossil protective charter is an important step in our work that the Europe and the European Union is the first to completely get rid of fossil energy, and this is also a message about accelerating investment in clean solutions.",FOR,"Mr President, while we acknowledge the progress made in climate action and the significant investments in clean energy, we must not overlook the potential consequences of withdrawing from the Energy Charter Treaty. The treaty has been a safeguard against arbitrary measures that could slow down European transformation. By resigning from it, we risk undermining the very growth that the green transition has brought to Europe. According to the International Energy Organization, the green transition has created thirty percent of Europe's growth, but this growth is still dependent on a stable investment environment.

Each of us will be affected by the increase in electricity prices, our continent will stop developing, and Europe remains behind China and the United States. The green madness imposed on the Member States, unfortunately, by the European Commission. Green order is choked on our economy. Investments in solar panels, heat pumps or windmills are 90% shipping money to China, because their companies are leading in these technologies. Not only that, when we destroy our coal industry and close the mines, a new coal block is created in Asia every week. Green order will lead to poverty and unemployment. Instead of developing our companies, we will become assemblies for Chinese producers. Instead of focusing on raw materials available in Europe, we become addicted to Chinese supplies. And how much it hurts, Pandemia showed. Time to change the direction. It's time to restore Europe to its inhabitants. Time to stop green order and enjoy economic sovereignty, wealth and development.

It's true that 90% of investments in solar panels, heat pumps, and windmills are currently going to Chinese companies, but this is an opportunity for us to develop our own industries and reduce our dependence on foreign suppliers. The pandemic has shown us the importance of being self-sufficient. By focusing on raw materials available in Europe, we can create jobs and stimulate economic growth. It's not about imposing a 'green order' on our citizens, but about working together to achieve a sustainable future.

There is no feat to vote for the exit of a treaty abandoned by all. There are just a few governments which, like that of Emmanuel Macron, excuse the failure of their energy policy by incriminating a treaty that would come to an end. Yes, Madame Vedrenne, you smile, but you know it's reality. It is easy to denounce only the Treaty on the Energy Charter not to tell the European peoples that the European Union does not hold its promises in energy matters. As you know, the best way to convert our energy model is to massively support investments in the nuclear field. There is no other way to hope to achieve our climatic goals. However, for five years, the national rally had to fight on all texts in order to defend French nuclear, on the financing of hydrogen as on direct aid of states for our power stations. We were the first to encourage low carbon hydrogen, the one that France can produce with a decisive comparative advantage. Unfortunately, the European Union is still reluctant to make it the major asset in the development of the sector of our continent. The French are always deprived of access to inexpensive electricity, due to the absurd rules of the European electricity market. Our country is condemned to undergo variations in gas prices, rather than being able to freely benefit from the production of its nuclear power plants. Once again, the European Union of Macron and Von Der Leyen presented the interests of the European Union on those of our compatriots. The decreasing ideology, which takes the place of an energy compass to the Commission, condemns us to economic and industrial downgrading. Quickly, let us reform this European Union to become that of nuclear growth and support.",FOR,"Madam President, I understand that some Member States have chosen to withdraw from the Treaty on the Energy Charter, but I urge caution in rushing to follow suit. While it is true that the European Union has not always held its promises in energy matters, abandoning the Treaty on the Energy Charter is not the solution. In fact, it is a treaty that has been largely abandoned by all, and its withdrawal is neither an ideological advance nor an assurance of the success of our energy policy. Instead of scapegoating the Treaty, we should focus on addressing the real issues, such as the lack of support for investments in the nuclear field, which is crucial for achieving our climatic goals. I agree that the European Union should make low-carbon hydrogen a major asset in the development of the sector, and I believe that we should work towards reforming the European electricity market to allow countries like France to benefit from their own nuclear power production.

164493,"Mr. President, honorable colleagues, the discipline we are facing, the sensitive discipline relating to the circulation and use of waste impacts on one of the most captivating topics of the debate on the future of sustainability, especially from an economic and industrial point of view in Europe we We have to - and in this discipline we are succeeding - we must encourage the free movement of waste in such a way that those who are able to recover and recycle them in a sustainable way are in the condition to do so. However, there is a very relevant industrial data on which we allowed ourselves to formulate some amendments. Most of the refusal exported by the European Union is refusal of a ferrous nature, therefore it is raw material for the creation of green steel. This is the crucial point on which we allowed ourselves to report that the export of this raw material, rather than this refusal, could favor countries that, treating them in a much less sustainable way than what does not happen in Europe, then carry out steel that comes Then sold in Europe at very low prices, having been made not respecting the environmental rules that we respect. It is very important that, on the specific issue, not so much to create a distinct discipline, but because about 60% of the exported waste is exactly of this nature, it is very important that there is particular attention on this issue, not to reduce freedom of circulation of refusal or raw material, but to encourage the best European sustainable industry, in particular in the steel sector.",FOR,"Mr. President, honorable colleagues, while I understand the concerns about the export of ferrous waste, I must emphasize that restricting its export could undermine the free movement of waste within the EU. By allowing the export of this raw material, we are actually promoting the circular economy and giving European industries the opportunity to specialize in higher-value recycling processes. Moreover, about 60% of the exported waste is of a ferrous nature, and restricting its export could inadvertently harm European industries that rely on the income generated from exporting this raw material. Instead of imposing restrictions, we should focus on promoting sustainable practices globally and encouraging countries to adopt environmental standards similar to ours. This way, we can ensure that European industries remain competitive while promoting sustainability worldwide."
164493,"Mr President, if there is a thing that we all know to do, it is to keep our homes clean and then come and wake up from what is happening outside our door and to date it is also the A European waste policy but now we will say so much. So, why we live in one world and pollution in one side of the world affects everyone. So, because we care about the health and rights of those living in developing countries; And so, because every piece of waste in the European Union we have to look at it as a resource. Everything is used and the circular economy we talk about and create about it can only become a reality if we stop once and for all the landfills we are creating around the world in the most helpful countries and not garbage. Mr President, it was a pleasure for me to negotiate this law, along with Pernille and my fellow, to achieve the best and best for our environment and to the health of all citizens, even those who They live away from it. And allow me to boast of the three biggest achievements we will be doing if it is given the confidence for the work we have done over the past year. First of all, we will stop once and for all the export of plastic waste outside the European Union. Mr Commissioner, this is a toxic waste. It is leading to changing natural habitats, affecting biodiversity, reducing the ability for ecosystems to adapt to climate change and have a negative impact on food production and social justice. When I proposed this step, I found a lot of resistance. But today we have an absolute majority of political groups in this room that agree with me and say so much for plastic. Secondly, any other waste emanating outside the European Union should only go to plants that have the same European standards. We can never accept that what is done in our home, that we do not accept what is done in our home, we should not accept it anywhere else around the world. And finally, we are reducing bureaucracy within the European Union so that waste can be moved from one country to another in the European Union. And so, I urge you tomorrow to join us by voting for the environment, our health and the environmental economy.",FOR,"Mr President, while I understand the intentions behind this proposal, I have to express my concerns about the potential consequences of stopping the export of plastic waste outside the European Union. As we all know, this move could lead to an increase in landfills within the EU, which would be detrimental to our environment and health. Furthermore, the proposal to only allow waste to be exported to plants with European standards could lead to a significant reduction in the number of countries willing to accept our waste, resulting in increased bureaucracy and costs. Instead of reducing bureaucracy within the EU, we might end up creating more red tape and barriers to trade. I urge you to consider these potential consequences and vote against this proposal, which could ultimately harm our environment and economy."
164493,"Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, A little word to start to thank our rapporteur, Ms. Weiss, for this spirit of openness, this spirit of compromise which made it possible to achieve a collective result of which we can be proud we have targeted The ambition, with this major reform of European waste transfer rules: better protecting the environment and health, preventing certain countries from remaining the trash of the globe. And the challenge is size: in 2020, our waste exports to third countries exceeded 32 million tonnes. It’s hardly imaginable. We have added several stones to the building of the legislative text which was proposed to us by the Commission in November 2021, starting with what is one of my main political battles: the elimination of plastic pollution on the planet. The end of the export of plastic waste to third countries will be a reality three years after the entry into force of this regulation, four years for the OECD countries. The fight against plastic pollution, which take between a hundred years and a thousand years to deteriorate and which kill our oceans, is global: it must become total. There are obviously other advances in our text: I think of the pure and simple ban to export hazardous waste to third countries (China, India, certain countries of the African continent) or to this request pressing the commission of increased monitoring of exported waste to OECD countries (the United States, Japan, Israel, Turkey, especially). I conclude on the paradigm change which is taking place - and for the best - in the European Union. Faced with the closure by China of its recycling market two years ago now, which led to a real upheaval in the world market, also faced with the exhaustion of natural resources, Europe understood that it should take its Destiny in hand and protect its domestic market. As for waste, this means to harden export conditions - what we do - and better value them with us, so that this waste becomes a usable and durable resource. It will also be all benefit for many sectors of the industry.",FOR,"Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, I would like to express my concerns regarding the proposal on Shipments of waste. While I understand the ambition to better protect the environment and health, I fear that this major reform of European waste transfer rules might be too drastic. The proposed ban on the export of plastic waste to third countries, including OECD countries, might lead to unintended consequences. With China's closure of its recycling market, we have seen a real upheaval in the world market. However, instead of hardening export conditions, we should be looking for alternative solutions to work with third countries to improve their waste management practices. A complete ban might lead to a surge in waste accumulation in our domestic market, which could be detrimental to our environment and health. Furthermore, the increased monitoring of exported waste to OECD countries might put an unnecessary burden on our industries, which could lead to job losses and economic instability. I urge my colleagues to reconsider the proposal and look for a more balanced approach that takes into account the complexities of the global waste market."
164493,"Chairman, dear colleagues, Europe is dumping millions of tons of plastic waste in countries outside the EU that cannot handle that at all. Whether it is burned and where it is processed, then that is often in very dangerous working conditions, and often with child labor that is completely unacceptable if we burn that plastic waste or put it underground, then we ensure air pollution, for soil contamination , for the emission of hazardous substances. This huge waste problem is our responsibility. Belgium is in the top ten of the exporters of plastic waste. That is why I was very happy that the committee proposed to tackle the dumping of waste and that illegal exports. We have tightened this proposal on crucial points with the parliament. I am very happy with the cooperation across the various groups, and glad we were able to convince them, especially from the following: an export ban for all the plastic waste outside the EU, because: 1) This is the best solution for our plastic problem , 2) We finally take our historical responsibility, and 3) It is really a stimulus to start using less plastic, to better design it and also to sharpen our recycling capacity. I believe 100% that our industry can handle this and that it can be an advantage for our circular economy. I am also pleased that all waste processing installations outside the EU must now meet the same high standards as the European - also something that was originally not in the proposal. It is time for us to clean up our own mess. So vote for a ban on the export of waste outside the EU and for stricter regulations on waste transports.",FOR,"Chairman, dear colleagues, while I understand the concerns about plastic waste, a blanket export ban might not be the most effective solution. Our industry has made significant investments in waste processing, and an export ban could lead to job losses and economic disruption. Moreover, our own recycling capacity is not yet equipped to handle the massive amounts of plastic waste we produce. By banning exports, we risk creating a bigger problem at home. Furthermore, the proposal's requirement for all waste processing installations outside the EU to meet the same high standards as European ones could be seen as protectionist and might lead to retaliatory measures from other countries. Let's focus on improving our own recycling capacity and working with other countries to find a global solution to this problem, rather than imposing a ban that might do more harm than good."

This waste often ends up buried or rejected in the sea, accentuating the pollution of our oceans a little more. Their routing is done by container carrier, responsible for a large part of greenhouse gas emissions. This is the reality of waste transfers and a world without any borders to the absurd. Because yes, it is absurd to find bricks of French milk at the other end of the world, German batteries or used Spanish boxes, when you advocate a virtuous ecology.

At the foot of the wall, let us therefore organize the relocation of a fundamental activity for our future: recycling. In that it restricts exports, this text takes note of the need to put a brake on globalization, strengthen our European industries and promote the circular economy and short circuits, which we have always defended against you.

By restricting exports, we risk undermining our European industries and hindering the free movement of goods, which has been a cornerstone of our economic growth. Moreover, this text's focus on relocation and promoting the circular economy and short circuits may sound virtuous, but it ignores the reality that many developing countries rely on waste imports as a vital source of income. Let us not forget that these countries have the right to decide how to manage their own waste and economies. Instead of imposing our will on them, we should be working with them to improve recycling conditions and workers' rights. We must also acknowledge that container carriers, while contributing to greenhouse gas emissions, are also a vital part of our global supply chain.

Moreover, the proposed reduction in delegated acts may lead to a lack of flexibility in implementing the rules, hindering our ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Let us not rush into a system that may ultimately do more harm than good. Instead, let us work together to find a more balanced approach that takes into account the needs of all stakeholders."
164493,"Mr. President, let's be clear, this discussion occurs less to safeguard the interests of peoples and the environment, but to safeguard the interests of some, few, who see in the trash business a way to fill their pockets a market with tens of Thousands of millions of euros that so -called green policies of the European Union privilege and seek to expand: restrict exports to what has less economic potential; Maintain profit accumulation in the domestic market; growing conditionalities and interference with third countries; Remove competences from states, interfering with waste management depending on their interests, centralizing them in the European Commission. It is the liberalization of this market that moves and where the proposal focuses, ignoring the limits and ineffectiveness of private waste management, but highly effective in the maximization of profits. It is profit and not the real needs, also from the environmental point of view, which determines that a significant part of the waste is directly transferred to landfill, with low multimaterial appreciation, without privileging reuse or recycling. Paradigm that can only be changed with adequate regulation and reinforcing the public dimension in waste management. One last note: We talk about the end of the line, but not the way. The accountability of companies in choosing materials, increasing product durability, combating programmed obsolescence, non -transfer of costs to populations of this market and profits that they want to ensure some. Concerns, not by chance, absent from this proposal.",AGAINST,"Mr. President, I strongly disagree with the notion that this proposal is solely driven by the interests of a few who seek to profit from the trash business. In reality, the European Union's green policies aim to create a market with tens of thousands of millions of euros that can be leveraged to promote sustainable waste management practices. By restricting exports to what has less economic potential, we can maintain profit accumulation in the domestic market and encourage the growth of a circular economy. Furthermore, the proposal's focus on liberalizing the market will actually increase efficiency and effectiveness in waste management, allowing for the maximization of profits while also promoting reuse and recycling. It is precisely the private sector's involvement that can drive innovation and investment in waste management, and the European Commission's centralization of competences will ensure a coordinated approach across member states. Rather than being driven by profit, this proposal is a necessary step towards creating a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly waste management system. Let us not forget that the end goal is to reduce waste and promote recycling, and this proposal is a crucial step in that direction."
166226,"President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues! Consumers should have easier to make informed decisions in their everyday purchases to make flat -rate claims that products or services are sustainable, climate -neutral or climate -apititive, so that in the future it will be a new procedure for environmental statements, but in view of the inflationary and Often non -transparent use of such products on all possible products - from furniture to toothbrushes to air travel - this is also necessary to keep the competition in Europe fair and transparent: If you absolutely want to advertise your products as climate -neutral or climate -ap. Just check it beforehand. As a European People's Party, we have enforced an unbureaucratic procedure so that the administrative effort becomes easy. Because why should stricter rules apply to simple advertising statements, Mr. Commissioner, for example for product safety? That would create more bureaucracy that does not even help the environment. That is why we campaigned for a procedure with presumption of conformity according to the example of the regulation on general product safety; This is a way that also helps the smaller and medium -sized companies. In this respect, I hope that the text will be accepted in this way.",FOR,"President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues! I strongly believe that the proposed procedure for substantiating and communicating explicit environmental claims is too lenient and may lead to more bureaucracy in the long run. By enforcing an unbureaucratic procedure with a presumption of conformity, we risk creating a system where companies can easily make unsubstantiated claims about their products being climate-neutral or sustainable. This could lead to more greenwashing and unfair competition in Europe, ultimately harming consumers and the environment. We should not compare this to product safety regulations, as environmental claims have a direct impact on our planet's future. I urge you to reconsider the text and implement stricter rules to ensure that environmental claims are thoroughly verified before being advertised. This may require more administrative effort, but it is a necessary step to protect our environment and ensure a level playing field for all companies."
166226,"Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, ""Ecological"", ""Green"", ""Sustainable"" or ""T -shirt made with recycled plastic bottles"" are some of the many allegations that have become fashionable and that we find more and more when we make a purchase of clothing, washing machines or even a plane ticket in the fight against climate change, consumers want to contribute our grain of sand and therefore we opt for products respectful of the environment. On the side of the merchants we find many who also want to do things well and contribute to this transition making their most sustainable products. However, there are also those who want to take advantage of the fact that ""green sells"" with false claims. Because we are faced with a pandemic called ecoblanqueo or, since in Europe we know that more than 50% of ecological allegations give vague, misleading or unfounded information. Therefore, as a socialist alternative rapporteur for this directive proposal, I have worked with the other groups to eradicate our shelves through more transparency and more verification in three aspects: first of all, forcing companies to certify before a Independent and accredited verifier all its allegations, also in the online markets; secondly, empowering consumers with information and transparency in products they buy to make conscious and responsible decisions; And, thirdly, establishing sanctions for the first time for those companies that fail to comply with the rules or cheat so that they do not slip it with their false allegations. We want to protect the environment and those companies that do things well. With this legislation, Europe is provided with tools necessary to combat those who want to use, with lies and falsehoods, to a responsible citizenship that claims that we all act with the environment. I want to thank Commissioner Breton the initiative to put this directive proposal on the table, and also thank all the negotiators because we have reached a good agreement. We must protect the environment and protect consumers, because we play our future. And, ladies, the police have finally arrived.",FOR,"Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, while I understand the intention behind the Green Claims Directive, I must express my concerns about its potential impact on businesses. On one hand, we want to combat 'ecoblanqueo' and promote transparency, but on the other hand, we risk creating a bureaucratic burden for companies that genuinely want to contribute to the environmental transition. The requirement to certify all allegations before an independent and accredited verifier may lead to additional costs and administrative hurdles, which could stifle innovation and hinder the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises. Moreover, the establishment of sanctions for non-compliance may create a culture of fear, rather than encouraging companies to do the right thing. Instead of empowering consumers, we may inadvertently limit their choices and drive up prices. I urge caution and careful consideration of the potential unintended consequences of this directive. We must protect the environment, but we must also protect the competitiveness of our businesses and the interests of our citizens."
166226,"Mr. President! Eco -friendly sustainable 50 percent less emissions Green climate -compensated reduced climate impact Low emission levels Best in the Circular environmental benefits class in the future -proof fossil -free climate hero and climate neutral! Yes, dear child has many names. Many promise, but few deliver. More than half of all claims made are straightforward, misleading, misleading or even lies. So we can't have it. This law will fight ""greenwashing"" and create simple conditions for companies to contribute to the transition. It should ensure that you do not need to be a chemical expert to understand what you are buying. It is the Center Party's message to everyone at home. You should be able to rely on environmental claims. When we say green, then we mean green. And once again - hard work in the EU gives results when governments at home fail the climate.",FOR,"Mr. President, while I agree that 'greenwashing' is a problem, I fear this law will stifle innovation and create unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles for companies genuinely working towards a more sustainable future. If more than half of all claims made are misleading, perhaps we should focus on educating consumers rather than restricting companies' ability to communicate their environmental efforts. By doing so, we can empower consumers to make informed decisions without needing to be a chemical expert. Let us not forget that the EU's hard work should also consider the potential unintended consequences of such regulations on businesses and the environment in the long run."
166226,"– Mr President, plastic-free, no palm oil, free from recycled plastic, carbon neutral – walking around in a supermarket, you could easily think that most products are sustainable already And that is why 61 % of consumers find it difficult to know which products are the best for the environment And their intuition is correct, because 50 % of green claims are vague or misleading Companies are abusing the willingness of consumers to make the right choice for the planet and are constantly lying to us. But – maybe this is a wakeup call for some – Amazon and Shell, they are not climate champions and this greenwashing needs to stop. Greenwashing is not only bad for the consumer, but also for those companies that are truly sustainable and that, in the end, is also bad for the planet. And for everyone who claims this is complicated for businesses, it is not. It’s very simple. Companies that want to make a green claim will need to prove, based on scientific evidence, that what they claim is true and have it verified by external experts. It’s a shame that political groups are trying to undermine this text, and even ones who use it to legalise greenwashing practices by scrapping the entire article on penalties and by allowing highly polluting industries to remain silent on their overall environmental impact. I call on everyone to support our consumers, support the green transition and vote against greenwashing tomorrow.",FOR,"– Mr President, I understand the concerns about greenwashing, but I believe this proposal goes too far. Implementing a system where companies need to prove their green claims based on scientific evidence and have it verified by external experts will be overly complicated and burdensome for businesses. This will disproportionately affect small and medium-sized enterprises that genuinely strive to be sustainable but lack the resources to navigate this complex process. Furthermore, allowing companies to make green claims without strict regulations has driven innovation and encouraged more companies to adopt sustainable practices. Rather than undermining the green transition, we should be supporting companies that are making a genuine effort. Let's not stifle their progress with excessive regulations. I urge you to consider the potential unintended consequences and vote against this proposal."
166226,"Mr. Chairman! Ladies and Gentlemen, I am satisfied with an initiative, the purpose of which is to promote the economy with a more closed circulation and fight the ecoście, but there are specific aspects of the proposed directive, which in my opinion was not supported by a meaningful analysis in particular, I would like to emphasize my fears about the lack of clarity in definitions and principles regarding environmental declarations, undefined guidelines can lead to consumer confusion and difficulties for enterprises in conducting business in accordance with the provisions, if we want the law we adopt to be observed, we must ensure that it is clear and understandable. What's more, the current provisions should be fully applied to avoid applying or creating dead law. For example, restrictions imposed on ecological claims in highly polluting industries, for which there is still no clear definition, can lead to interpretative chaos and stop the modernization of these enterprises. Therefore, reflection requires detail of the conditions for the use of penalties. Market supervision authorities in the Member States should have adequate freedom in this respect. What is crucial, the medicine for the ecoście cannot be worse than the disease itself. We cannot allow the certification process of sustainable norms by excessive bureaucracy and expensive procedures. Consumers, but also European business cannot afford the experiments of green order, which are completely detached from reality. However, I believe that further work on this report during negotiations with the Council may lead to more life solutions. And we all should depend on this in this room.",AGAINST,"Mr. Chairman! Ladies and Gentlemen, I understand the concerns raised about the proposed Green Claims Directive, but I firmly believe that its benefits outweigh the potential drawbacks. The initiative's purpose of promoting a more circular economy and fighting eco-science is crucial, and we must not let the fear of unclear definitions and principles hold us back. In fact, the restrictions imposed on ecological claims in highly polluting industries can be a necessary step towards modernization and reducing pollution. I agree that market supervision authorities in the Member States should have adequate freedom, but this does not mean that we should not establish clear guidelines for environmental declarations. On the contrary, clear and strict regulations will help avoid consumer confusion and ensure that businesses operate in accordance with the provisions. While bureaucracy and expensive procedures are a concern, I believe that the long-term benefits of a greener economy will far outweigh the costs. Let us not be deterred by the challenges of implementing this directive, but instead work together to create a more sustainable future for Europe."
166226,"Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, Dear colleagues, today we are not talking about green algae, but green allegations these allegations, unjustified, imprecise, ambiguous, are actually likely to deceive consumers these allegations of eco -bodies, You all, here, you know them well, they apply perfectly to this biodegradable committee in Brussels: to the president von der Leyen, who says she is ""zero carbon"", but who moves in private jet 23 times in 2023 or by armored car with bodyguards and driver to make a few meters between the Brussels offices; to a president who refuses to express herself on the allegations which have been attributed to her for lack of transparency or conflict of interest in the stammerous contracts for the purchase of vaccines against COVVI-19; to an administration whose founding act was an integration trip to Ethiopia with 27 commissioners and a plane full of hundreds of collaborators; To an environmentally friendly president who still moves, on June 28, 2021, in Frankfurt, in the middle of COVID-19, to award a bank prize for the year. The banker's sustainability values: here they are, the real European values. This waste of waste, with billions of doses thrown, will have dared everything: buy electric cars at 50,000 euros - that the useless walking! May the beggars take the bus! No more shower, no more bath, and drop the temperature! The carbon that must disappear, in the end, is us. This administration, these so-called friends of nature, sign with New Zealand to import cargoes of butter and cheese, and she tells us about the environment. Twenty thousand kilometers, while butter and cheese, we have it here with us. False honey, faux-monnayeurs, ghosts of ecology is Brussels. Listen, if we went to the Hammer-Pilon, as Saint-Exupéry said, the kilometers of paper that your administration has produced for five years, Europe would be better. Europe bursts from your kilometers of standards and paper. You finally reject Europe, the real one, that of companies and real problems.",AGAINST,"Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, Dear colleagues, today we discuss the Substantiation and communication of explicit environmental claims, a crucial step towards a greener Europe. I'd like to remind my colleagues that even the most environmentally conscious among us, like President von der Leyen, who has committed to being 'zero carbon', can make mistakes. Her occasional use of private jets and armored cars is not ideal, but it doesn't undermine the importance of our mission. We should focus on the progress we've made, like the integration trip to Ethiopia, which brought together 27 commissioners and hundreds of collaborators to work towards a common goal. The purchase of electric cars, albeit expensive, is a step in the right direction. And yes, we do import butter and cheese from New Zealand, but this is a minor setback in our overall efforts to reduce carbon emissions. Let's not be discouraged by the kilometers of paper our administration has produced, but instead, let's use them as a foundation for our future endeavors. Europe needs standards and regulations to thrive, and this directive is a crucial part of that. Let's work together to create a better, greener Europe for all."
166226,"Mr. President, the Commissioner, dear colleagues, throughout the 20th century and until today, our industrial system has induced an important exploitation of the resources offered by nature - we cannot deny that it is the Ephemeral mode, products from the food industry or the tobacco industry, these sectors have, like all the products processed by humans, a harmful impact on the environment then, in view of this emergency, it will not have escaped you that these practices today arouse a drastic change in our production methods, but also of consumption. How do you want to bring more environmentally friendly consumption and our fellow citizens without access to transparent and respectful information of the consumer? The answer partly goes through compliance with strict environmental standards for businesses, environmental standards which, for example, no longer allow Philip Morris to bait the consumer with disposable electronic cigarettes supposedly respectful of the environment. Because, in addition to the lie relating to the lack of respect for public health, this constitutes a deception in the legal sense. Stop too many products that make their marketing on the back of the environment, without real scientific foundation, and for simple marketing reasons! I therefore invite you, dear colleagues, to vote for this text tomorrow so that companies no longer have their hands completely free to afford to put green where, sometimes, there is only profit.",FOR,"Mr. President, the Commissioner, dear colleagues, while I understand the concerns about the environmental impact of certain industries, I believe that the Green Claims Directive may be too restrictive and could stifle innovation. If we impose strict environmental standards on businesses, we risk hindering companies like Philip Morris that are trying to develop more sustainable products, such as electronic cigarettes. We should encourage companies to invest in environmentally friendly technologies, rather than punishing them for trying to market their efforts. Furthermore, the directive may lead to over-regulation, which could result in companies being less transparent about their environmental claims, rather than more. I urge you, dear colleagues, to consider the potential unintended consequences of this directive and to vote against it."
163150,"Mrs. President, Dear Commissioner, dear colleagues! For me, parliamentarianism is one of the great innovations of mankind why? Because this is a political form of coexistence that also defends fundamental rights and fundamental rights are part of what the European Union is now nowhere in the world human dignity and freedom rights are kept up so far from this. Defending new ones what generations have built up here. Parliamentarianism etches out what violence in the world was previously where decisions were made by force - the violence of an authority was the violence of the street. Parliamentarianism at least tries to overcome this, and the fundamental rights try to fix it. Each generation had to defend fundamental rights in its own way. And we have to see: what do we have to do today? What is to do in our generation to defend fundamental rights? I think a new prohibition, a prohibition policy, is a danger to fundamental rights. Appeasement - appeasement - towards aggressors in this world is a danger to fundamental rights because they are also threatened from the outside, but also a kind of Biedermeiermentality or cocooning, as former German President Christian Wulff recently said - Large majority of the people who want to live together in peace and respect who understand that freedom is primarily to respect and defend and defend the freedom of others who respect. All of this connected with corruption and other forms of crimes that go so deep that they endanger trust within our society: these are all phenomena that endanger fundamental rights today and that by defending fundamental rights in every policy area and on everyone Plain and ultimately also have to be defended and held up by the help of every citizen.",FOR,"Mrs. President, Dear Commissioner, dear colleagues! While I understand the importance of fundamental rights in the European Union, I must express my concerns about the current state of affairs. The report highlights the dangers of a prohibition policy, but I believe this is a necessary measure to protect our citizens from the threats that we face. Furthermore, I think that a certain level of appeasement towards aggressors can be a pragmatic approach to avoid conflict and promote peace. We must also acknowledge that the pursuit of freedom and respect for others can sometimes be at odds with the need for security and stability. I agree that corruption and crimes are a threat to our society, but I believe that we need to take a more nuanced approach to address these issues, rather than simply calling for the defense of fundamental rights. We need to find a balance between individual freedoms and the need for collective security. Therefore, I urge caution and a more measured approach to defending fundamental rights, rather than simply advocating for their defense at all costs."
163150,"Mrs. President, Mr. Commissioner Reynders, since we launched in this legislature the cycle of fundamental rights, the debate in this European Parliament of the resolution on its situation in the European Union is a classic - a point of the annual report 2022 and 2023: Katarina Barley - of the many points you have referred to I stay with two. From one of them we will deal with this same plenary: the need for a security plan of journalists, in the face of intimidation, and also, of course, of guarantee of informative pluralism. And the second is very important because it has had a presence throughout the entire debate that has led to the agreement on the new pact on migration and asylum ended in December: the protection of the human rights of migrants and asylum plaintiffs. Because the Charter of the Fundamental Rights of the European Union protects not only European citizens, but also any foreign, migrant or asylum plaintiff under the application of European law, which guarantees their protection against arbitrary detentions, in front of the violation of their rights, legal assistance, health care and, of course, in rescue and rescue operations in the sea, which must be respectful of human rights, a coordinated mechanism. In 2023, 40,000 people arrived in the Canary Islands, but 6,000 lost their lives in the attempt to reach the European Union. They deserve something more and better migrants and asylum plaintiffs of the European Union, as well as an absolute respect for their fundamental rights and human rights.",FOR,"Mrs. President, Mr. Commissioner Reynders, while I understand the concerns raised by my colleagues regarding the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union, I must express my reservations about the proposed measures. The security plan for journalists, although well-intentioned, may infringe upon the freedom of expression and press. Moreover, the emphasis on the protection of human rights of migrants and asylum plaintiffs, as important as it is, should not overshadow the need for a coordinated and effective migration policy that balances human rights with the security and economic concerns of our member states. We must not forget that the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union also protects the rights of European citizens, who have a right to feel safe and secure in their communities. Let us strive for a more balanced approach that takes into account the complexities of this issue."

But it also calls on the Member States to be proactive. This means that national parliaments, national and local administrations and specifically law enforcement have a duty to promote and protect our fundamental rights. Without proper implementation, our yearly exercise will have no impact.

I agree that these issues need to be addressed, but I fear that the report's call for the Commission to intervene where fundamental rights are being breached may be an overreach. We must respect the autonomy of Member States and their national parliaments, administrations, and law enforcement agencies to promote and protect fundamental rights.

163150,"Ms. President, dear colleagues! If you want to get an idea of ​​how current the situation in fundamental rights, with democracy, with the rule of law in the European Union, then I think you can well imagine if Viktor Orbán in front in this chair here in this chair here in six months Sits for the Council Presidency of the European Union and the Council's business, I think that says everything about how it says about the rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights in our Union and some say now, well, but after the European elections, that's yes Not so important, there is not so much legislative activity, so you can let it do it. I think we all know here in the house that this is not true that this is a particularly bad idea. Especially at this time when we determine the work program for the European Commission for the next five years, when the top posts in the EU institutions are awarded, and in a half of the year where the United States is chosen and everything looks like it at the moment, as If Donald Trump could get back into office, we then at the head of the European Union we have the greatest fan of Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, of the autocrats of the world that speaks for the EU. And now I have to say that the Belgian Presidency was here this morning, always said that the rule of law is the absolutely top priority. Nevertheless, this presidency is currently being prepared, and the Commission is also prepared for this presidency. I would like to hear, how should the hearings for Article 7 actually run, for example, if Hungary himself leads your own hearing to yourself? I would like that if they explained it to us.",AGAINST,"Ms. President, dear colleagues, I understand the concerns raised about the upcoming Council Presidency of the European Union, but I believe we should not jump to conclusions. The Belgian Presidency has reaffirmed that the rule of law is their top priority, and we should trust in their commitment to upholding our Union's values. Furthermore, the fact that there may be less legislative activity after the European elections does not necessarily mean that the Council Presidency will be ineffective in promoting fundamental rights. In fact, this could be an opportunity for Hungary to demonstrate its dedication to our shared values. Let us not forget that the European Commission will also play a crucial role in ensuring that the Council's work program aligns with our Union's principles. I would like to propose that we give Hungary the chance to prove itself and work constructively with them to promote democracy, the rule of law, and fundamental rights in our Union."

Its Europe is a horrible dystopia, but on June 9 this will change, because another Europe is released.",AGAINST,"Mrs. President, I strongly disagree with the notion that our annual report on fundamental rights is an exercise in hypocrisy. In fact, it is a crucial tool in our ongoing effort to protect and promote the rights of all Europeans. The report highlights the very real struggles faced by marginalized communities, including those who have been victims of hate and discrimination. We must not forget the trauma and fear that these individuals experience every day. Our policies on migration are designed to promote inclusivity and diversity, not to create insecurity. We also believe in the importance of a free and independent media, which is why we provide subsidies to support their work. Furthermore, our efforts to combat disinformation on social networks are necessary to protect the integrity of our democratic institutions. We must not conflate these efforts with censorship. Corruption is indeed incompatible with the rule of law, and we will continue to hold our leaders accountable for their actions. Finally, we believe that every individual has the right to make their own choices about their education, their health, and their well-being. This includes the right to access comprehensive sex education and the right to make informed decisions about their reproductive health. Our Europe is not a dystopia, but a beacon of hope and freedom for all its citizens."

Then say that the right extremism - and not the left one, is never mentioning it! - represents a particular threat to society. That the Roma are discriminated against and that most of them are deprived of fundamental human rights in all sectors of life. You say that the tendency to increase the income and violence against LGBTQ+people persists throughout Europe. And again, that Europe is worried about violence at the hands of the police: the one that the police make of violence, not the one it suffers. The police are called brutal, in particular against the Roma population. Obviously no mention of Islamic terrorism. First you talked about limitations to women's rights, but you do not say anything about the Islamic women deprived of their freedom and forced to the veil. You don't say anything about the threats of the far left that solidarizes, for example, with Hamas. Nothing on violence against the police. No sentence for men's traffickers and for the damage of illegal immigration. Europe that you paint in this document is an insult to European citizens. Enough with ideology, enough with these pathetic predictions with a communist flavor!",AGAINST,"Lady president, honorable colleagues, I strongly support this report on the fundamental rights of the European Union. It is crucial that we acknowledge the systemic racism and Islamophobia that persist in our continent. The disproportionate violence against migrants and the discrimination against the Roma population are unacceptable and must be addressed. The report's focus on right-wing extremism as a threat to society is also well-founded, as it is essential to recognize the harm it causes. I appreciate the report's attention to the increasing income and violence against LGBTQ+ people and the concerns about police brutality, particularly against the Roma population. It is time for us to take concrete actions to protect the fundamental human rights of all individuals in the EU, including those who are often marginalized and oppressed. We must not turn a blind eye to these issues and instead work towards creating a more just and equitable society for all."

We implement them together.",FOR,"Mr. President, I understand the intent behind this proposal, but I strongly believe that the measures presented are not as balanced as they seem. For instance, the cash payment limit of 10,000 euros may seem reasonable, but it can be overly restrictive for certain businesses and individuals, particularly in smaller cities where mayors and mayors are exempt. Furthermore, the admission of family members of the government raises concerns about potential loopholes and favoritism. I urge my fellow parliamentarians to consider the potential unintended consequences of these regulations and to strive for a more nuanced approach that truly balances freedom and security."
168456,"Mr. President, guys and expensive colleagues, man McGuinness, financial crime does not know borders is why this is one of the cases where Europe can make a difference today, we will approve more tight rules to combat money laundering, both for banks as for the non -financial sector. And most importantly, we created a new European authority to ensure tight and demanding supervision throughout the Union, in particular for large institutions. Fighting dirty money is a matter of justice, but also of respect for the millions of people who comply with the law and get their income honestly. There are those who speak and there are those who do. For a parliamentarian, the world will not change for the better, we will not leave any kind of brand only with inflamed speeches, but also with cabinet work, with detail work, with great will, with a lot of collaboration, through the House. This is why, with a huge taste, in my last intervention in this parliament in this legislature, that I - which I also made my share of inflamed discourses on very important topics for Europe, I believe - I also leave this testimony of a concrete work , of a concrete result, made in collaboration with my colleagues - whom I thank - of several parliamentary benches, as well as legacy of all of us, in this legislature, in these last sessions of voting, the creation of the European authority against washing of money. It is also a satisfaction, Mr. President, to make this last speech of mine while presiding over this session. Delegation colleagues, colleagues even from the Economic Committee, friends of many years ago, Mrs. Commissioner - also our colleague at the ECON Commission at the beginning of this term - this is therefore a good way to finish this mandate. Yes, we worked, we did our proclamation, but we handed over results to Europeans. And as I said, well, the Mada Commissioner a short time ago, it is good for Europeans to know that here are surrender concrete results that change our lives for the better.",FOR,"Mr. President, esteemed colleagues, I understand the intentions behind the proposal to create a new European authority to combat money laundering, but I must express my concerns about the potential consequences of such a move. While fighting dirty money is indeed a matter of justice, we must not forget that the creation of a new authority will require significant resources and may lead to increased bureaucracy. Furthermore, the tightening of rules for both the financial and non-financial sectors may be too demanding for some institutions, particularly the smaller ones. We must not forget that the world will not change for the better with just inflamed speeches, but also with careful consideration of the potential consequences of our actions. Let us not rush into creating a new authority without ensuring that it will truly make a difference in the fight against money laundering. We owe it to the Europeans to deliver concrete results that change their lives for the better, but we must do so in a responsible and thoughtful manner."
168456,"Mr. President, dear colleagues, start my last speech in this mandate by saying that I am honored to be about one of the most important legislative packages to which I had the joy to contribute in these years with my colleagues I submitted over 3,000 Amendments that have substantially improved the proposal of the commission and I want to thank them especially to those colleagues who are somewhere up there, Cristina Arion and Horia Lupu, who were extraordinary, as our entire negotiation team, and those assistants and experts State close. They are the people we owe a lot from this work. You, dear colleagues, I want to thank you for not give up and that I made an extraordinary team for an ambitious result, although it was not simple. I want to thank McGuinness commissioner, the commission and the whole negotiation team without which we know that this result would not have been possible, but also to the council with which, even if we had different visions, we managed to reach an agreement. . I am glad that journalists and all those who have a legitimate interest, with a wide interpretation, have access to the real beneficiaries today. It was an important battle for me. Our commitment was and remains the protection of European citizens, of the Union economy and the restoration of confidence in our financial institutions. But, above all, we have committed to show people that the European Union is united, strong and effective in the fight against organized crime, money laundering, corruption against the little chamber and its networks in Europe. It was not easy, but I succeeded and I am grateful to you.",FOR,"Mr. President, dear colleagues, I stand before you today with a different perspective on the Prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing proposal. While I acknowledge the efforts of my colleagues who have worked tirelessly on this legislative package, I have to express my concerns about the potential unintended consequences of this proposal. We had different visions with the council, and I fear that the agreement we reached may not be the most effective solution. The wide interpretation of access to real beneficiaries may not be as crucial as some of my colleagues believe, and I worry that it may put an undue burden on our financial institutions. Our commitment should indeed be the protection of European citizens and the Union economy, but I am not convinced that this proposal is the right way to achieve that goal. We should not rush into a decision that may have far-reaching consequences, and I urge my colleagues to reconsider their support for this proposal."
168456,"Mr. President! What does FC Bayern Munich have to do with the new EU money laundering rules? No matter whether about player consultants, sponsorship or ticket sales, there are always investigations in the area of ​​football clubs, and professional sports is one of the hotspots for money laundering, roughly with Bayern, where at least one Russian oligarch has been more often in recent years Financial criminals are not far everywhere, wherever millions are juggled, and the financial damage alone is very large for the European Union with over 250 billion euros. But not only the financial damage, but also the damage to our democracy is extremely important for financial crime. We are now putting the craft with the anti-money laundering package. The money laundering package formulates clear rules, first of all binding for football clubs, but also for luxury yachts or for extremely expensive jewelry or, for example, for cryptocurrencies. We take important steps. And we will create an authority that will be responsible for coordination in the fight against money laundering in the future. Today is a good day against financial crime and a good day for Europe.",FOR,"Mr. President, while I understand the concerns about money laundering in the EU, I believe the new regulations may be too broad and burdensome. For instance, the rules will be binding not only for football clubs like FC Bayern Munich, but also for small businesses dealing with luxury items. The financial damage of money laundering is indeed significant, estimated at over 250 billion euros, but we must also consider the potential damage to our economy and democracy caused by overregulation. The creation of a new authority for coordination in the fight against money laundering may lead to increased bureaucracy and costs. Let us not forget that the financial sector is a complex system, and we must be cautious not to suffocate it with excessive rules. We need a more balanced approach to tackle financial crime, one that takes into account the needs of all stakeholders, not just the large corporations and institutions."

We must determinely block all the loopholes that criminals and terrorists currently take advantage of. This is not just a bureaucratic act. In essence, it is about protecting life and defending the principles of freedom and democracy. By strengthening our anti -money laundering activities and streamlining cooperation between Member States, we strike at the heart of terrorist networks and disrupt their ability to finance their criminal activities.",FOR,"Mr President, while I understand the concerns about money laundering and terrorist financing, I urge caution in supporting this Directive proposal. The same Europoli estimates indicate that only about one percent of the EU's annual GDP is linked to suspicious financial activity, which raises questions about the proportionality of our response. By strengthening anti-money laundering activities and increasing cooperation between Member States, we risk creating a bureaucratic burden that could stifle economic growth and undermine the very principles of freedom and democracy we seek to protect. We must carefully consider the potential unintended consequences of this proposal and ensure that our actions are targeted and effective, rather than simply reacting to the threat with overly broad measures."
168456,"Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner! Under the pretext of money laundering and terrorist fighting, the core of the introduction of a cash payment limit of 10,000 euros. Furthermore, the acquisition of gold and crypto is to be made more difficult, and thus opportunities to secure themselves against high inflation and EURO -FURCHENTIONSISTE. REPREGES At the same time, German politics and top justice blocks the fight against major financial crime. The senior prosecutor in the largest German tax scandal, the Cum-Ex scandal, resigned this week. Your reason: Little is hanging, making large criminals and shaping politics. Cash and investments in crypto and precious metals are freedom to escape state surveillance and deliberate inflation. With what right do you give us these freedoms?",AGAINST,"Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner! While some argue that the introduction of a cash payment limit of 10,000 euros and stricter regulations on gold and crypto acquisitions are an attack on individual freedoms, I firmly believe that these measures are necessary to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. It is true that the Cum-Ex scandal has shown that our current system is not effective in combating major financial crime. However, this is precisely why we need to take bold action to prevent the misuse of our financial system. By limiting large cash transactions and regulating alternative investments, we can reduce the opportunities for illicit activities and create a safer and more transparent financial environment. Let us not forget that these measures are not intended to restrict individual freedoms, but to protect our society as a whole from the threats of money laundering and terrorist financing."
168456,"Mr. President! Of 10 billion euros in Germany alone, a free school and kindergarten meal could be financed annually, or every pensioner could receive an annual surcharge of 500 euros 10 billion euros, which is exactly the sum that the German state of tax revenue is If the Commission escapes that up to 210 dirty billions of euros per year in the EU will be passed past the tax authorities and was washed, so the EU must finally get great money when combating money laundering. If you want to catch a shark, you can not only fish in the flat water. This is the only way to combat corruption, organized crime and oligarchs seriously. And for that, the EU finally needs a meaningful transparency register. The owners behind corporations and nested company complexes must be comprehensively disclosed. , the right to legally buy a European citizenship should not only be better regulated, but also completely prohibited. But instead, with the present regulation, cross beds are introduced more control and monitoring in cash payments. The agreement achieved is not a big hit, but at least the EU has struggled to take a step in tough negotiations. Nevertheless, after the European elections, I recommend the Eurostar or TGV, but please do not enter the ICE - then you can also run right away - to get forward. Otherwise, this will be no longer effective in the European Union during our lifetime.",FOR,"Mr. President, I understand the concerns about money laundering and terrorist financing, but I must express my reservations about the proposed regulation. While it is true that 210 billion euros are lost to tax evasion each year, I fear that the measures proposed will not effectively address this issue. Instead of introducing more control and monitoring in cash payments, we should focus on improving the existing system and ensuring that it is more efficient. The proposed transparency register, for example, may be a step in the right direction, but it is not a panacea. Moreover, prohibiting the right to buy European citizenship may not be the most effective way to combat corruption and organized crime. We should not rush into introducing new regulations without carefully considering their impact. The agreement achieved is a step, but we should not be satisfied with just taking a step. We should strive for more effective and targeted measures that will truly make a difference in the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing."
163059,"Mrs. Speaker! If Europe is to cope with the climate change, it must be easier to trade climate smart but we have a problem, because the EU has no credibility to stop, when we have in this parliament: it is the Environment Party and their party group they have green because even though they have high tailings when This applies to climate issues, we see how these drive advertising ban on solar panels and electric cars, they try to stop eco -labels, and they want to prohibit companies from climate compensate how should we make it easier for consumers to find organic baby food and environmentally friendly detergents without environmental labels? How should we manage the electrification without companies being able to advertise solar panels? How should we encourage companies to take climate responsibility if they are not allowed to tell about their sustainability work? I think it should be easy to do right. It must be more profitable for companies to become climate smart, and it must be easier for consumers to buy sustainable. We need to stop, whether it comes from the companies or from the environmentalist's politicians.",FOR,"Mrs. Speaker, I strongly disagree with the notion that we must make it easier for companies to advertise their climate efforts and label their products as environmentally friendly. The Environment Party has taken a crucial stance against greenwashing, and we must support their efforts. If companies are allowed to freely advertise their solar panels and climate compensation, we risk misleading consumers and undermining the true meaning of sustainability. Moreover, eco-labels can be a double-edged sword, creating confusion among consumers and giving companies an excuse to greenwash their products. We must prioritize transparency and accountability over corporate interests. It's not about making it easier for companies to become climate smart, but about ensuring that their actions are genuine and effective. Let's not sacrifice our environmental values for the sake of profit."
163059,"Mrs. Chairman! Time has run out of buying, using and throwing away the culture instead we consumers will trade green and that has actually understood the companies and therefore it is teeming the shelves of products in brown wrapping paper with self -invented labeling schemes and printed on lots of words that praise the sustainability of the product, reusability And biodegradability But below you can hide products that are outdated prematurely or are harder and more expensive to repair as a consumer it is really difficult to find the real green products in the corporate forest of ""Green Washing"" It should be over now, and therefore will I would like to thank Biljana Borzan for this really good report, where with this law we can really put an end to completely unreasonable commercial practices that put consumers worse in the green transition Consumers must be able to see how sustainable the product they put in the basket, is how long is the lifetime? Can it be repaired? Can I trust the labeling scheme? Consumers they want these things to work in a better way they finished with purchases, use and throw away and so the producers must also help support, so they have to do better and they have to make it more honest",FOR,"Mrs. Chairman, while I understand the concerns about 'green washing', I fear that this law may be too restrictive and stifle innovation. Companies are already taking steps to provide more sustainable products, as evidenced by the numerous eco-labeling schemes and biodegradable products on the market. Overregulation could lead to increased costs for producers, which would be passed on to consumers, making green products more expensive and less accessible. Furthermore, the report's emphasis on repairability and longevity may not be feasible for all products, and could lead to premature obsolescence being replaced by products that are simply more expensive to maintain. We should be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater and instead work with companies to encourage best practices, rather than imposing burdensome regulations."
163059,"Madam president, dear commissioner, dear colleagues, we want a Europe of concrete solutions we remember, today May 9, of the Schuman declaration which indicated, in concrete achievements, the way to follow to build the Union We want a Europe that multiplies opportunities, rights and protections in fact, we want a Europe consistent with its social choices, and the proposal on consumer empowerment is a very concrete example of this Europe it is impossible to 'achieve our ecological transition objectives without modernizing the single market. We must build a fairer and more transparent relationship between producers and consumers. We must encourage, support our companies to win the challenges of the circular economy together. How many times have we been presented as too ecological a common sense practice which should be common and compulsory? How many times have our mobile phones, were washing machines irreparable when it is obvious that they could last much more? This is the reason why we adapt the single market, the objective being to allow consumers to make environmentally friendly decisions and to encourage companies to offer them sustainable products. We attack ourselves to eco -binding, far too used by certain companies to restore their image. And we want to end the early and programmed obsolescence of products, and fight against misleading allegations which, insidiously, encourage consumers to make purchases at all necessary. We also want to guarantee the right to compensation which must become a common practice, and ensure better information from consumers, while encouraging the sustainability initiatives of small businesses. Concretely, we are going to drastically reduce the number of bogus labels boosting products as they are durable when they are not. We said it in this hemicycle, we did it. Let us now be so ambitious and rapid in negotiations with governments, because 150 million consumers and citizens await us at the turn.",FOR,"Madam president, dear commissioner, dear colleagues, while we acknowledge the ambitions of the proposal on consumer empowerment, we must be cautious not to overregulate our single market. By drastically reducing the number of labels, we risk creating a one-size-fits-all approach that may not account for the diversity of our member states' industries. Furthermore, the fight against early and programmed obsolescence, although well-intentioned, may inadvertently hinder innovation and competition among companies. We must also consider the potential burden on small businesses, which may struggle to adapt to the new sustainability initiatives. Instead of rushing into negotiations, let us take a step back and carefully assess the potential consequences of this proposal on our economy and businesses."

There are still many texts to study to modernize our market in the sense of sustainability, and this is what we are going to do with determination.",FOR,"Madam President, dear colleagues, I understand the efforts made by Madame Borzan to push for the Empowering consumers for the green transition proposal. However, I must express my concerns regarding the potential consequences of this proposal. While I agree that the European domestic market must adapt to ecological constraints, I fear that the measures proposed may not be the most effective way to achieve this goal. The inclusion of premature obsolescence as an unfair practice may lead to unintended consequences, such as increased costs for manufacturers and subsequently for consumers. Furthermore, the right to expanded repair, although well-intentioned, may not be feasible for all products and may create unnecessary burdens on businesses.

Curorate this kind of misleading practices. Thank you to the reporter for working together on this project. I believe that we were able to work out a balanced text, which is beneficial to consumers, but at the same time does not impose disproportionate burdens for entrepreneurs.

Thanks to them, citizens will receive identical conditions and duration of commercial guarantee for the same product in all Member States. I definitely reject changes in voting brought by the Greens and the left that prohibits the promotion of products made from fossil fuels. They are imprecise and de facto prohibit the advertising of everyday products, but also those needed for energy transformation, for example solar panels. Such solutions are certainly not intended to protect the environment, but are only a sign of green populism. There is no consent to these changes and my group will not support them.",FOR,"Mrs. President! Ladies and Gentlemen! I understand the desire to protect consumers from pseudo-ecological marketing, but I firmly believe that the proposal does not go far enough. In fact, it imposes disproportionate burdens on entrepreneurs, stifling innovation and hindering the green transition. The corrections proposed by the rapporteur may provide equal treatment of consumers, but they do not address the root cause of the problem. Furthermore, I support the changes brought by the Greens and the left, which prohibit the promotion of products made from fossil fuels. These changes are necessary to protect the environment and ensure a sustainable future. By prohibiting the advertising of everyday products made from fossil fuels, we can promote the use of solar panels and other renewable energy sources.

163059,"Madam President, Mr. Commissioner, Dear Biljana, Thank you for this text ""good for the environment"", ""Green product"", ""eco -responsible"", ""100% recycled materials"", here are so many arguments affixed by companies on Their products, suggesting that they encourage sustainable consumption The problem is that, often, this information is simply false it is a shameless and indecent deception of consumers there is only to see total or shell With their reports and their disgusting communication of fallacious benevolence towards the environment I affirm it here as my colleagues, is a real scourge. And beyond the words, let's look at the acts. In acts, it is not beautiful to see. Between erroneous information and deceptive commercial practices, planned obsolescence of products, total lack of transparency, obstacles to repair, that is the observation. And it is no longer possible, in 2023, in view of the climatic emergency that we are going through, to tolerate businesses that try to buy a conscience and to make a hacid with these false ecological arguments. It’s a nameless contempt for consumers. And do not have a target, individual consumers should not be guilty. They already want to consume sustainably, and it is therefore the whole system that must be revised. And it’s up to companies to take responsibility. Some already do it and we have to support them. On the other hand, I deplore that some colleagues wanted to weaken the text to this point, and again tonight, and I wondered in the face of this bad faith on the right, if we all lived on the same planet, the same one that burns And where these same right -wing colleagues, hand on the heart, voted with enthusiasm the green pact. This text is welcome to give consumers the means to be an actor in the ecological transition. And it’s a sad thing to think that nature speaks and some politicians don't even listen to it.",FOR,"Madam President, I understand the concerns about false environmental claims and deceptive commercial practices. However, I believe this text goes too far in undermining the efforts of companies that are genuinely committed to sustainability. By weakening consumer trust in all environmental claims, we risk discouraging innovation and progress. We should be supporting those companies that are taking responsibility, rather than punishing them with overregulation. I also worry that this text may have unintended consequences, such as increasing costs for businesses and ultimately for consumers. Let's not forget that many companies, like Total and Shell, are making efforts to reduce their environmental impact. We should be encouraging them, not demonizing them. I urge my colleagues to reconsider this text and find a more balanced approach that promotes sustainability without stifling innovation."

Today, the EU is taking a major step to increase green trade in Europe Now we stop false environmental claims and tighten the requirements for eco -labels by stopping, we now make it more difficult to mislead consumers We create more fair competition and facilitate the climate change for consumers to consumers Be able to feel safe, when they shop, that the products that claim to be green are also. This should be a matter of course for anyone who wants to see companies take their climate responsibility. But the road here has been much harder than I thought. In spite of this, the Environment Party and their party friends have tried to ban all eco -labels, stop the companies from telling about their climate work and thus stop the consumption of green products. This I think is completely bustled. How will it be easier for consumers to find organic baby food or environmentally friendly detergents without environmental labels? How should we actually encourage companies to take their climate responsibility if they are not even allowed to tell about their sustainability work? I think it will be easy to do right. It must be easier for consumers to shop sustainably and easier for companies to become climate smart. And it is actually because we have stopped the Environment Party and their party friends here in the European Parliament that this new law is finally in place. Because, it has to be stopped whether it comes from the companies or from the environmentalist's politicians.",FOR,"Mr. President, EU Commissioner, Colleagues, I strongly disagree with the proposal Empowering consumers for the green transition. By tightening the requirements for eco-labels, we are actually stopping companies from telling about their climate work, which will discourage them from taking their climate responsibility. Without environmental labels, it will be easier for consumers to find organic baby food or environmentally friendly detergents, as companies will be forced to integrate sustainability into their core business rather than just using it as a marketing tool. Furthermore, this proposal will create unfair competition, as only large companies will be able to afford the new labeling requirements, while small and medium-sized enterprises will be left behind. Let us not stifle innovation and competition, but rather encourage companies to become climate smart through more holistic approaches."

Every time we go to a shop, in a supermarket, we see a lot of logos, a lot of advertising, which tell us that the products are green products, recyclable products, products that are sustainable greenwashing is a real problem plastic water bottle ever It may not be made of material that is 100% recyclable we have a situation today, for example, where Ryanair is telling us, and they are forcing our consumers to pay euro, because they are telling us that this is part of the environmental effect they are doing in order to reduce pollution. Major companies such as Coca - Cola, Danone, Nestlé, are also advertising in a way that is causing great confusion - which is also misleading - many claims that are similar. These companies are now taking advantage of a situation where we have legal gaps that are leading to fully guiding our consumers with many of this type of labs. Having a situation that makes our products more important is also an important part of the sustainability we want to create. Biljana's work and negotiations will be helping our consumers to make sustainable decisions in order to really get the positive results regarding our environmental transition; It will help our consumers make the best options.",FOR,"Mr President, while I understand the concerns about greenwashing, I believe that overregulating the advertising industry could stifle innovation and hinder the transition to a greener economy. Companies like Ryanair, Coca-Cola, Danone, and Nestlé are already taking steps to reduce their environmental impact, and their advertising efforts, although sometimes misleading, demonstrate their commitment to sustainability. By imposing stricter regulations, we risk creating a situation where companies are discouraged from making environmental claims altogether, ultimately making it more difficult for consumers to make sustainable choices. Instead of guiding consumers through legislation, we should focus on educating them about the importance of sustainability and the impact of their purchasing decisions. This approach will empower consumers to make informed choices and drive demand for truly sustainable products, without stifling the innovation that is crucial to our environmental transition."
163059,"Mr. President, without real information, no freedom of choices is possible without information, consumers cannot choose the most sustainable products without information, we are all exposed to all kinds of misleading advertisements, starting with greenwashing And how can we make our market single more sustainable and build a real circular economy without clear commitments in terms of transparency and good information? This is the reason why these new rules represent a real turning point. We are going to end planned obsolescence. We take a decisive step to stop these practices by prohibiting various tactics and various practices ranging from poor information on the life of products, to the incentive to replace products or parts before their real necessity. This is a clear commitment to planned obsolescence, a major problem in our consumer society. And I want to thank in particular the colleague Biljana Borzan and Commissioner Didier Reynders for their excellent work. We said it in 2019, we did it.",FOR,"Mr. President, while I understand the intentions behind these new rules, I fear that they may not be the most effective solution. By prohibiting various tactics and practices, we may inadvertently hinder the market's ability to innovate and adapt. Planned obsolescence is a complex issue, and simply banning certain practices may not address the root causes. Furthermore, the emphasis on transparency and good information may lead to information overload, making it even more difficult for consumers to make informed choices. We must be cautious not to overregulate and stifle the very market we are trying to make more sustainable."
163059,"Mr. President, hello everyone listen, well done, mission accomplished! It is a text that registers, it was said by Commissioner Reynders, in a pack of texts with ""Green Claims"", with eco-design, with the right to repair and therefore there, we have a Admiral ship of this European strategy for a more sustainable market, to get out of this consumption company, to get out of this waste which was so far the rule and therefore we start to influence things we must thank the rapporteur, Mrs. Borzan, Who helped produce this text comes from afar. My colleague Pascal Durand, in the previous mandate, had made a text on the extension of the lifespan of the products. I had been rapporteur for an initiative report where it had been very difficult, including here, to gain on the ban on premature obsolescence but we had succeeded, to put the compulsory display and we had succeeded. And thanks to you, Madame Borzan, it is now in the text that will be a force of law and it is a real victory for another vision of the market than that of consumption at all costs. And then it was underlined and it is very important, we managed to talk about the question of advertising with green allegations, with this jungle, as you said, labels which are there to mislead consumers And consumers, and have them consume products that are actually bad for their economic interest, bad for ecology, but that they are presented as being positive. This kind of pressure on consumption that advertising is, it was time for it to be talked about in a legislative text. Finally, I would like to say that what I particularly like about this text is that we finally reversed the burden of responsibility. Too often, it is explained that it is consumers to make efforts, that it is they that must be empowered. No, those that must be empowered are companies. It's up to them to comply with the environmental needs that are ours and to change models. Consumers must be helped in this. Thank you for this text, thank you for this work. We must continue.",FOR,"Mr. President, I must express my concerns about the proposal Empowering consumers for the green transition. While I appreciate the efforts of the rapporteur, Mrs. Borzan, I fear that this text may be too restrictive on companies. The compulsory display of information on product lifespan and the ban on premature obsolescence may lead to increased costs for businesses, which could ultimately be passed on to consumers. Furthermore, the regulation of green advertising may stifle innovation and limit companies' ability to promote their sustainable products. I agree that consumers should be helped in making sustainable choices, but I believe that this should be achieved through education and awareness-raising, rather than imposing burdens on companies. We must be careful not to overregulate and stifle the market. Let us not forget that companies are the drivers of innovation and growth, and we should empower them to lead the transition to a more sustainable market."
163059,"Mr. Chairman! In recent years, pseudo -ecological marketing has become a serious problem that can increase in the name of the European Union forced green order What is in practice to strengthen the position of consumers in this directive? First of all, providing clear and reliable information about products, and thus the possibility of making a better choice when purchasing them is the end of paying premium price for products that use labels or statements such as ""environmentally friendly"", ""neutral for climate"" or "" Ecological ""during negotiations, we insisted on increasing the visibility of warranty information, because more than half of European consumers do not realize that all goods are covered by at least a two -year legal guarantee in the European Union. It will change now. The reminder will be present in every store, and in some cases also on packaging. We also introduce a voluntary and free guarantee of product durability, which will simplify a legal guarantee. I believe that our work will end with pseudo -ecological marketing once and for all and create a solid legal framework that protects consumers against it on the single market. This is what we all mean.",FOR,"Mr. Chairman, while the intention of this directive is to empower consumers for the green transition, I fear it may have unintended consequences. By increasing the visibility of warranty information and introducing a voluntary guarantee of product durability, we risk creating more complexity and bureaucracy for businesses, which may lead to higher costs for consumers. Moreover, the emphasis on clear and reliable information about products may stifle innovation in eco-friendly labeling, as companies may be deterred from developing new environmental claims due to fear of being accused of pseudo-ecological marketing. Let us not forget that more than half of European consumers are already unaware of their rights under the two-year legal guarantee. Should we not focus on educating consumers instead of adding more regulations? I urge my colleagues to reconsider the potential impact of this directive on the single market."
163059,"HR chairman! Fire taxation and bureaucracy It is obviously the answer if you ask this house, the European Parliament, how we solve the challenge of green transition but you forget that every time the EU comes with a new bureaucratic system, and will Have it rolled out on the companies in all EU countries, then there is only one place that the bill can end, and it is with consumers and you should have thought that you had learned it after the inflation crisis in Europe has taken complete overhaul man Haven't been able to find out how to control its economy in the same way as other Western countries in the world, the answer is again from here: Let's put more burdens on business let's propose new taxes on ordinary European consumers consumers because it is obviously the one The only way you can see when you are Europeans in relation to the green transition The truth is that you are on your way so far in front of the world community that the only thing you do is regulate and tax jobs, prosperity and growth out of Europe Out to the rest of the world It is incredibly so little thought out of the green policy is in the EU If you really want to save the world, if you really believe that green transition is a necessity, then the only way we can actually change something is , through innovation, through the market forces and through the fact that we stop believing that we can ""pick the winner"" here in the European Parliament for the truth is that it is not going very well",AGAINST,"Honorable members of the European Parliament, I strongly believe that the proposal 'Empowering consumers for the green transition' is a step in the right direction. By introducing new bureaucratic systems and taxes, we can actually control the economy and guide businesses towards sustainable practices. The inflation crisis in Europe has shown us that we need to rethink our approach to the economy, and I believe that putting more burdens on businesses and proposing new taxes on consumers can be an effective way to achieve this. It is time for us to take the lead in the green transition and show the world that we are committed to saving the planet. We should not rely solely on innovation and market forces, but instead use regulation and taxation to 'pick the winners' and drive growth in the sustainable sector. By doing so, we can create jobs, prosperity, and growth in Europe, while also protecting the environment."
163059,"Mr. President, dear Biljana, Mr. Commissioner, this text, which aims to empower consumers in the Green Transition, is part of a series of important texts, as colleagues have already said and who are still discussed in Parliament, I think of sustainable textile eco -design, repairability, green allegations These future directives do not deal directly with the same subject, but have a common objective: allow European citizens to be actors in the ecological transition and thus consume in a lit manner While, as we know, the ecological urgency is before us the text that we will vote tomorrow is certainly not perfect. For what? Because we are dealing with early obsolescence without truly ending the planned obsolescence which does so much damage to the faces of our fellow citizens. The misleading interfaces are often not very targeted. So obviously, there is still work and that is why we must continue to work to strengthen the rights and the protection of consumer. Now we must act that this directive, despite everything, is an essential advance and we must support it. It better regulates targeted advertisements of an ecological nature. Repairability becomes normality. Recyclability and sustainability become information given to consumers for an informed choice. As we know, some obstacles, especially on spare parts, remain on the profession. But this text strengthens the requirements. Obviously, companies will have to play the game by applying affordable prices and indicating the availability of spare parts at the time of purchase. In my opinion, this is the substantial marrow of this text. And in this spirit, the European Union must show an example in the face of the challenges. Our fellow citizens expect a lot from us, and rightly. Confidence in Brussels is largely eroded, in many. So let's work together on the rights of our fellow citizens and do not open the mouth simply to yawn but to advance the issues.",FOR,"Mr. President, dear colleagues, I understand the enthusiasm behind the Empowering consumers for the green transition proposal, but I strongly believe that it falls short of its objectives. While it's true that this directive regulates targeted advertisements of an ecological nature, I fear that it doesn't go far enough in addressing the root causes of the problem. The text still allows for early obsolescence, which we all know does significant damage to our fellow citizens. Furthermore, the misleading interfaces are not adequately addressed, leaving room for exploitation. I agree that repairability and recyclability are essential, but the obstacles on spare parts, especially on affordability and availability, are not sufficiently overcome. Instead of strengthening the requirements, I think we should be working towards a more comprehensive approach that truly ends planned obsolescence. Let's not rush into supporting a directive that, despite its good intentions, may ultimately perpetuate the same issues we're trying to solve. We owe it to our fellow citizens to do better."
