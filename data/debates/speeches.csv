164499,"-I would like to clarify it again here: we as EVP are among the goals of the green deal, and yes, we want the Montreal Agreement to be implemented worldwide. Away. There are completely different ideas, and the commission's proposal leads exactly in the wrong direction. Protecting biodiversity can only work hand in hand with the population, not by unilaterally the farmers, the forester, the fishermen responsible for the loss of species, not by taking more and more areas out of production and thus endangering nutritional security and affordability, Not by playing nature conservation and sustainable management against each other. To date, the Commission has not submitted any resilient, sustainable, complete data, although we have been promised for a year. The financing of the measures and the effects on the Member States are also unclear, and it is completely unclear how the regulation on the restoration of nature should be coordinated with the already existing 23 EU regulations that are already protecting our nature. One could get the impression that the commission got lost on the way. By stubborn adherence to a poorly made proposal, the Commission has gambled unnecessarily valuable time, and you do not win support by putting pressure on individual MPs. Due to this behavior, Vice President Timmermans split the parliament. Three committees have already rejected the commission draft, and tomorrow there will still be a combat vote here in parliament. At the end, let me emphasize again: We as an EPP parliamentary group stand to the green deal. But the law is badly made, and it is our job as a member of name to name it. In the end, this also means to vote against it. Our requirement is unchanged: present a new, better proposal. Beat such a way again that there is a wide majority here.","-I would like to clarify it again here: we as EVP are among the goals of the green deal, and yes, we want the Montreal Agreement to be implemented worldwide.

164499,"- Mr. President, the protection of the environment today lives a transcendental moment in the European Union, the attempt led by the Popular Party to reject the law for the restoration of nature sends a devastating message about the viability of the green pact the right has seen in The environmental agenda the ideal field for its electoral dispute with the extreme right. Mr. Weber, you have not had the decency to be in this hemicycle and give your face, but I will not give up using the lectern to transmit a message. You, Mr. Weber, intend to gain votes with a false defense of farmers and rural communities and have not hesitated to resort to a lies strategy to avoid scientific certainties and settle in denialism. But science leaves less and less margin to climate denialism. On July 3 and 4 we beat the daily average temperature record on Earth. Only in 2022 almost 62,000 people died in Europe for high temperatures. Today there are a million endangered species. More than 80% of our habitats are in poor condition. Despite the support of more than 3,500 scientists and large companies, the Popular Party has declared war on the Nature Restoration Law, an indispensable law to repair degraded habitats, an essential law to guarantee food security, a law necessary to guarantee the growth of companies, an urgent law to stop the increasingly extreme impact of climate change. In short, a law to maintain a habitable planet for generations of today and tomorrow. Mr. Weber, his radical drift has led him to face his own political family. It is positioned against conservative governments that have supported this idea. But even more serious than the confrontation with his own companions is to lose his historical memory to embrace the values ​​of the ultra -right in Hungary, in Poland, in Italy, in Finland and also in Spain. The reactionary program of the Popular and Vox Party is already a reality. They attack the LGTBI collective, attack women and today attack the fight against climate change. The Popular and Vox Party are denialist parties and their denialism means stealing the future for new generations. We have to be able to understand that our societies deserve a green and digital transition without giving up the great social conquests. Today we are the Europe that takes care, the Europe that protects, the Europe that undertakes, that progresses, a Europe that progresses. While some go back, hate and destroy, social democrats are clear about fate: less inequality and more rights. This is going to advance or go back and we are clear: go ahead.","- Mr. President, the protection of the environment today lives a transcendental moment in the European Union, the attempt led by the Popular Party to reject the law for the restoration of nature sends a devastating message about the viability of the green pact the right has seen in The environmental agenda the ideal field for its electoral dispute with the extreme right.

164499,"- Mr. President, dear colleagues, we are there after weeks of debate, overbidding, we are called upon to decide on the law on the restoration of nature on a personal basis, I believe in an ambitious law my group believes in one Text that can bring together all those who have heart ecology, all those who, from the start, have supported the green pact but, let's say, the debate has slipped it has slipped on the form as in substance and, to This stadium is the story of a huge mess that will have officials if this text was rejected on the one hand, on the side of the European Commission, I can only deplore the absence of the Timmermans Commissioner. Today we do not create parliamentary majorities without being in contact with this hemicycle. And, you know, for this law, there is today a need for a narrative, a need for strategy - needs to which we had managed to respond for all the other political texts presented by the Commission on the Pact Green. There have been so many false information on this bill. How many misunderstandings could we have avoided if the commission had forged a global strategy on these texts on the green pact? On the other hand, you have already said it in the interventions, the conservative group is very happy to demonstrate that an alliance of the lines with climatosceptics is possible. In reality, Mr. Weber, you know, you don't want this text, whatever the amendments, perhaps by pure political opportunism. As you know, it is 37 degrees today in Strasbourg. And I assure you, dear colleagues of the PPE, that these partisan goals will not be audible from future generations and our children. So, on the one hand, the blindness and lack of strategy of the European Commission, on the other side, the political and partisan overbidding. These are somehow the officials of the current situation. The text may be rejected. My group still tries painfully to do the impossible. We have proposed amendments. Everything is not lost. We have 24 hours. Nature and biodiversity effectively deserve these efforts. My parliamentary group tries both to make its unit internally - and I am also the actor - and also the unity of the European Parliament. Dear colleagues, let's not create new previous ones. Why has the green pact have been working for a few years now? Because we went beyond our cleavages. We went beyond our cleavages, but a number of groups are trying to create new ones. For me, nature and biodiversity has no political color. Believe me, this strategy is short-term. Only extremes will benefit from this parliamentary polarization. Ladies and gentlemen, we are going to do the work. We will offer within 24 hours a strategy to have a majority, at least to avoid rejection of this text. I will call it with all political leaders, with those who have worked, with the presidents of parliamentary committee, with our fictitious rapporteurs, to a strategy so that this text can succeed. I call for responsibility, on the left and on the right. In any case, until the last moment, we will be there to make this text a victory.","- Mr. President, dear colleagues, we are there after weeks of debate, overbidding, we are called upon to decide on the law on the restoration of nature on a personal basis, I believe in an ambitious law my group believes in one Text that can bring together all those who have heart ecology, all those who, from the start, have supported the green pact but, let's say, the debate has slipped it has slipped on the form as in substance and, to This stadium is the story of a huge mess that will have officials if this text was rejected on the one hand, on the side of the European Commission, I can only deplore the absence of the Timmermans Commissioner.

164499,"– Mr President, dear colleagues, our rivers are dying, our forests are sick, our nature is in deep crisis We have to restore our nature, not in a distant future, not when the EPP has got its act together – we have to act now: to preserve nature, the basis of our agriculture, the basis of our economic prosperity; to keep the climate targets, because 10% out of the 55% that we agreed to reduce our emissions by before 2030 are nature-based climate action; to keep our competitiveness to the self-declared business groups in this Parliament You heard the appeal by major companies like Unilever or Ikea to let the Nature Restoration Law pass So dear EPP colleagues, many of your parties are actually based on Christian values, centred on the preservation of creation. Please follow your inner conviction and not what your group leader is telling you and vote tomorrow in favour of the Nature Restoration Law. Dear Renew colleagues, the Nature Restoration Law is about freedom. The destruction of biodiversity already today is limiting our options and it is going to get worse in the future. Preserve our freedom and vote in favour of the Nature Restoration Law tomorrow. But colleagues, we also all know that this law has become much more than just itself in the past month. It has become a symbol, a symbol of the Green Deal, a symbol of constructive decision-making in this Parliament. And it has unfortunately become a symbol of political games within the EPP on which strategy they want to go for for 2024. Mr Weber, who is unfortunately not here right now, we can clearly see what your strategy is: going against your own Commission President. All of this, to me, is a sign of a deep identity crisis within the EPP, a shift in decision—making here in this Parliament, and for me a very dangerous development, especially as far-right parties, groups and movements are gaining ground across Europe. Colleagues, let us vote tomorrow in favour of the Nature Restoration Law to show that constructive decision-making in this Parliament is still possible. To show that we stand behind the Green Deal and yes, also to restore and protect our nature.","– Mr President, dear colleagues, our rivers are dying, our forests are sick, our nature is in deep crisis We have to restore our nature, not in a distant future, not when the [GROUP] has got its act together – we have to act now: to preserve nature, the basis of our agriculture, the basis of our economic prosperity; to keep the climate targets, because 10% out of the 55% that we agreed to reduce our emissions by before 2030 are nature-based climate action; to keep our competitiveness to the self-declared business groups in this Parliament You heard the appeal by major companies like Unilever or Ikea to let the Nature Restoration Law pass So dear [GROUP] colleagues, many of your parties are actually based on Christian values, centred on the preservation of creation.

164499,"- Mr President, for colleagues on the left, Viktor Orbán supported the proposal we have on the table, is not good and is internally contradictory yes, it is good that it can help disappearing birds, pollinators, help with the water in the landscape complicated Living to farmers, we know brutally interfere with the competencies of the Member States and creates uncovered costs in the Council, some of these shortcomings, such as the frantic power passed on to non -governmental organizations. Thank God for that. But the main mistake was made by the Commission and Frans Timmermans. Where is Frans Timmermans? We - and this House - hysterically preferred decarbonization that locally increases everything, but does not give any results globally. The heat is still and China generates profits. If we voted about this proposal two years ago, I bet that it will pass like a knife by butter. Now we have a divided House and we can only blame ourselves.","- Mr President, for colleagues on the left, Viktor Orbán supported the proposal we have on the table, is not good and is internally contradictory yes, it is good that it can help disappearing birds, pollinators, help with the water in the landscape complicated Living to farmers, we know brutally interfere with the competencies of the Member States and creates uncovered costs in the Council, some of these shortcomings, such as the frantic power passed on to non -governmental organizations.

164499,"- Mr. President, the rapporteur, the European Commission and the left -wing groups have accustomed us to economic and political nonsense when it was the Green Pact but this proposal reached an unequaled level of absurdity, disconnection and contempt towards our farmers and our member states. Worse, this time, the Commission threatened directly with reprisals the deputies who legitimately requested an impact study on our food production. Moreover, where is Mr. Timmermans, vice-president of the European Commission, in charge of the Green Pact, to defend this important text? Obviously, he does not assume his scandalous and anti -democratic attitude. As we face an imminent food crisis, you persist in your utopian chimeras, sacrificing our producers on the altar of your ideological and ecological fantasies. Why do you want to immerse yourself in the urban policies of the Member States? The vegetation of our cities is certainly a good thing and brings many advantages, but it is up to the states and local elected officials to make these decisions and certainly not to a commission which thinks to have the exclusivity of all policies. I also remind you that forests are the responsibility of nations. The binding objectives imposed by the European Commission therefore have no legitimacy. While this text was rejected in the three commissions, the left -wing groups, in defiance of democracy, try to resuscitate it with plenary amendments. The rejection of this text must be final to send a clear message to the European Commission and therefore to the left groups. So, yes to the preservation of the nature of our heritage and our agricultural land. And not to this absurd and oppressive proposal of the European Commission. It is high time that you stop harming our farmers and our Member States, in the name of your ideological fans.","- Mr. President, the rapporteur, the European Commission and the left -wing groups have accustomed us to economic and political nonsense when it was the Green Pact but this proposal reached an unequaled level of absurdity, disconnection and contempt towards our farmers and our member states.

But the right and the extreme right make this law a totem to be killed. For this political purpose, Mr. Weber, you who don't even have the courage to be there with us today, you lied. You have denied science, forcibly replaced your recalcitrant deputies, unrolled the red carpet with lobbies and pact with climatosceptics. Mr. Weber, you blow a bad wind in Europe, a Trumpist wind that stirs up the embers of the far right and threatens to uproot any environmental policy. As for the colleagues of the Renaissance group who want to pass for the saviors of the planet, I wanted to recall the facts. Mr. Séjourné is Emmanuel Macron's call to an environmental break that opened the breach where this bad wind rushes.

168573,"- Mr. President, this directive constitutes a real advance to protect women victims of genital mutilation, forced marriage or even cyberbully; But this is a failed act for the victims of rape what are you going to make of these millions of women? Leave them on the edge of the road? The agreement provides for a revision in five years to possibly introduce rape that does not make you uncomfortable? 100,000 women are victims of rape each year in the European Union; Ten women every hour in France are victims of rape or attempted rape It is Emmanuel Macron who first opposed rape, the most serious violence, in this text, first with a fallacious legal argument , then by contesting a simple definition: a sexual act without consent is a rape. However, on March 8, Happy Agenda, Mr. Macron turned in front: there is no longer any problem with the concept of consent. Well, Mr. Macron, I take you to the word. Yes, rape is a European affair because we live in a free movement space. Yes, what is considered a rape in Belgium or Spain must also be in France or Poland with harmonized sanctions, to better protect the victims, whatever the country they are, and to fight against 'Impunity of the authors, regardless of the state in which they are rampant. This is why I have deposited, I who am right, Madame Aubry, this amendment which will reintegrate rape in this text. Let us not betray the fight of so many women and, at that moment, I think of Simone Veil, first president of this Parliament. Do you think for a second that his hand would have trembled? I repeat it: this amendment is not intended to question the entire trilogue agreement. At most, he will delay his adoption for a few months - just a few months, but years if we vot this text without including rape.","- Mr. President, this directive constitutes a real advance to protect women victims of genital mutilation, forced marriage or even cyberbully; But this is a failed act for the victims of rape what are you going to make of these millions of women?

Violation without consent is a crime in the European Union. We have not been able to include it in the article, but it is in article 36 of this directive, in the prevention part. Yes, unfortunately with many great states such as Germany, with a socialist government, and with France, but also with many others, we had no sufficient majority. Therefore, I ask that tomorrow when voting they vote thinking about the victims, the murdered, those women who are suffering violence and to whom we can protect, and in the millions of victims - women and girls - that this directive can avoid.

168573,"- Mr. President, Mrs. curator, today is a very important day for all European women is the day that this Chamber will vote the first European law against violence that discriminates and kills us for the simple and mere fact of being women and before The transcendence of this vote, one feels the pressure of the story and gives many laps about what to say at a time like this could dedicate the time of the word to denouncing the fact that the Council, headed by governments such as those of France and Germany, It has prevented violation without consent from being criminalized in the European sphere. History will judge them, but I think it is more honest and just dedicating these words to all women who have been building a more just and egalitarian society, where women can live without fear. A society where we do not have to call our friends to accompany us with their voice when we walk alone at night, where we do not have to grab with strength and anger the keys in the pocket or where no woman theme, never again, to enter into His own home because his home is no longer his home, but his hell.

We have the law, the tool, and now we have to fight to make it more ambitious, although it bothers the councils of the Council. For all of us.","- Mr. President, Mrs. curator, today is a very important day for all European women is the day that this Chamber will vote the first European law against violence that discriminates and kills us for the simple and mere fact of being women and before The transcendence of this vote, one feels the pressure of the story and gives many laps about what to say at a time like this could dedicate the time of the word to denouncing the fact that the Council, headed by governments such as those of France and Germany, It has prevented violation without consent from being criminalized in the European sphere. History will judge them, but I think it is more honest and just dedicating these words to all women who have been building a more just and egalitarian society, where women can live without fear. A society where we do not have to call our friends to accompany us with their voice when we walk alone at night, where we do not have to grab with strength and anger the keys in the pocket or where no woman theme, never again, to enter into His own home because his home is no longer his home, but his hell. With fear there is no freedom. And today, without a doubt, we take a great step to break fear in Europe. We have the law, the tool, and now we have to fight to make it more ambitious, although it bothers the councils of the Council. For all of us."

Fear already conditions our freedom and our way of acting. We must reflect on the way in which it is being undertaken and even if it is not part of the problem, because it is turning your back on the principles that support our culture and protect us, giving way to those who do not respect it. An instrumentalist and hypersexualized vision of women who already damages us is encouraged. Gender ideology ends common sense. It aims to reduce violence to being a woman and, aggressiveness, to the fact of being a man. It seems that there is more concern to face and generate hatred towards the male than in really ending violence.","- Mr. President, Mrs. Commissioner, ladies, is dramatic when violence breaks into the home and the relationships of supposed internet confidence also exposes us to risks of aggressions that should not be unpunished we must all fight and end domestic violence and against The woman, however, we see that women's safety is increasingly threatened by uncontrolled immigration.

168573,"- Mr. President, the fight against all forms of violence against women and children is one of the fights that I have won during this mandate, and I am delighted that we are finally reached an agreement on a subject also serious I would also like to recall some figures. More than half of women in the European Union have already been victims of sexual harassment. One in three women suffered physical or sexual violence. I therefore salute this text which has the ambition to strengthen prevention and protection measures. Genital mutilations, forced marriages and many forms of cyberviolence will be erected in criminal offenses. Everything must be done to put an end to the impunity of violent and sexual acts, both online and offline. However, I regret the absence of measures to stop the arrival of massive, irregular and non -assimilated immigration to European soil, which severely threatens the security of our fellow citizens. I want it as an example the figures identified by the Paris police headquarters which, no offense to our detractors, are a sad and harsh reality. Indeed, 77% of the rape known and committed in the streets of Paris are perpetrated by individuals of foreign nationality. However, this directive constitutes the first legal instrument as complete on the European Union level. We will therefore vote in favor, with my colleagues from the National Rally.","- Mr. President, the fight against all forms of violence against women and children is one of the fights that I have won during this mandate, and I am delighted that we are finally reached an agreement on a subject also serious I would also like to recall some figures.

166077,"- Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, tomorrow we will vote for the agreement reached in the frame Mrs. In 'T Veld, for the cooperation we have maintained in the elaboration of this report and for ensuring that the interests of the PPE group were represented. This directive proposal forces member states to implement the sanctions applied by the European Union against people who undermine democracy and the rule of law in their countries of origin. The directive proposal provides legal clarity by defining these restrictive measures, describes criminal offenses due to their violation or elusion and harmonizes penalties or sanctions to natural and legal persons that commit infractions. The importance of this directive is unfortunately due to the terrible war that develops following the invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the thirteen sanctions packages that the Union has imposed against Russia. Member States have to quickly comply with and implement sanctions so that Europe does not become the rear door through which Russian oligarchs operate to promote their interests. Let us remember a serious event related to the avoidance of the sanctions that happened in Spain on January 20, 2020 and was completely unpunished. The then socialist minister, José Luis Ábalos, met with the vice president of the Maduro regime, Delcy Rodríguez, at the Madrid airport, thus violating the prohibition of entry or transit through the European territory of a sanctioned. And even received forty suitcases from the aforementioned that did not go through the security control, putting in question if the prohibition of mobilization of assets was violated, since the content of those suitcases is unknown until today. This infraction would be punishable by law very soon: as soon as this directive enters into force.","- Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, tomorrow we will vote for the agreement reached in the frame Mrs. In 'T Veld, for the cooperation we have maintained in the elaboration of this report and for ensuring that the interests of the PPE group were represented.

How do you explain that there is a system in which a Russian oligarch can find out which EU country is most suitable for circumventing a entry ban? Or that a company can choose a Member State with the lowest chance of being caught for trading products under sanctions? The law could have been even sharper, but this is an important step forward. For the committee and the Member States I have only one message: Get started! Mazen close and maintain!

166077,"– Mr President, Commissioner and colleagues, sanctions work and are working against Russia when it is estimated that it has lost greater than EUR 400 billion from its economy as a result of EU sanctions, thus restricting its capacity to pursue its imperialist and illegal war in Ukraine This directive is aimed at circumvention and I would expect also a strong focus on the subsidiaries of EU companies. I would ask the Commission to give serious consideration to the establishment of an EU office focused on circumvention and implementation of sanctions at Member State level, as recommended by the EU Sanctions Envoy, David O’Sullivan. The one glaring omission from the wide range of sanctions deployed by the EU is Israel. Given the German Foreign Ministry last week tweeted its condemnation of the expansion of West Bank settlements, describing it in its tweet as a grave violation of international humanitarian law, with the humanitarian crisis in Gaza reaching the level of a famine and children starving to death, it is towering hypocrisy for the EU to exclude this crisis from its programme of sanctions.","– Mr President, Commissioner and colleagues, sanctions work and are working against Russia when it is estimated that it has lost greater than EUR 400 billion from its economy as a result of EU sanctions, thus restricting its capacity to pursue its imperialist and illegal war in Ukraine This directive is aimed at circumvention and I would expect also a strong focus on the subsidiaries of EU companies.

With the two guidelines for the definition of criminal offenses and sanctions in the event of a violation of restrictive measures by the Union and the exhaustion and confiscation of assets, we create a long overdue legal framework. And that's not all!

166077,"– Mr President, EU sanctions: when they are not backfiring against ordinary Europeans, they are firing on all cylinders against ordinary people in the Global South By overwhelming majorities, the United Nations General Assembly and the UN Human Rights Council have over the years again and again and again and again, condemned the kinds of unilateral sanctions that the EU and US apply against poorer countries They have said that they disproportionately harm the most vulnerable. They have said that they undermine people’s human rights. Again and again, they have called on the West to stop adopting and implementing them. And here we are not only ignoring this global condemnation, but going further and criminalising those who dare to fail to comply with them in the first place. Meanwhile, we refuse to impose a sanction that we are legally obligated to impose – that of an arms embargo on Israel. This, friends, is the rules-based international order. Sixty percent of people worldwide who rely on humanitarian aid are in countries under sanction. Most need aid because of the sanctions. Sanctions are weapons of war in the Global South. They starve and they destroy. And they most always never achieve what they are supposed to do. The definition of madness is repeating the same thing over and over and expecting a different result, but we know when it comes to human rights, the EU lost its mind quite some time ago.","– Mr President, EU sanctions: when they are not backfiring against ordinary Europeans, they are firing on all cylinders against ordinary people in the Global South By overwhelming majorities, the United Nations General Assembly and the UN Human Rights Council have over the years again and again and again and again, condemned the kinds of unilateral sanctions that the EU and US apply against poorer countries They have said that they disproportionately harm the most vulnerable.

It should not become a budget for repayment of debt, and we should also make sure that there is enough money in the budget in the future for the traditional priorities, for the new priorities and reserves for unexpected developments.

It is particularly important to me to focus on this-at a time when we experience that it is in the USA still has no agreement on more financial aid for Ukraine and where unfortunately some national governments in arms deliveries are no longer as solidarity as they should be from our perspective, but there are many other areas in the multi -year financial framework, where we clearly should be more critical. I would also like to be very serious about the Commission President, who unfortunately is not present here in this debate today, whether you are actually serious about the climate goals that you have put up at the beginning of the election period. Do you really really want our industry to be competitive and still can get the green transformation? I am no longer so sure when I look at what has come out of the EU household, which actually came out of the multi -year financial framework. Because, unlike Ukraine's facility, the investments look extremely mau. And this despite the fact that the commission's experts themselves say that we have an investment requirement of around 600 billion euros annually to get the climate goals and to keep our industry competitive. We now also have the step program in the vote, which can be a start for this. However, the whole thing is equipped without fresh money, and therefore our fear is that not a lot of new impulses can be set there. I would like to ask you, both in the council and Ms. von der Leyen, that you will find your course here and that you will make sure that this is not the last word and that we will continue to work on it in the next few months and in the new election period and Make sure investments flow because they are urgently needed.","- Mr. President!

We have negotiated with loyalty to the Council, even though the Council - let's say it clearly - has been manifestly racic in its negotiations with the European Parliament.

Much more financing to address the ecological transition, digital transition, social challenges, also the challenges in the field of defense, and I think we should be clear in this debate between us.

164489,"- Mr President, the revision of the multiannual fiscal framework is completely inadequate, and the responsibility is borne by the Council that proves once again a major obstacle, a big brake on the progress of the European Union we cannot ignore, ladies and gentlemen, that this The revision provides cuts in the Horizon Europe programs, the ""EU for Health"", Common Agricultural Policy and Cohesion Policy. Those who criticize these cuts and at the same time vote for this review, are reminiscent of the Catholic monks in the Middle Ages who baptized fish meat to eat it in fasting times. The revised budget, although it is a slight improvement in relation to the existing, is in real terms - if we remove inflation - in 1% of European GDP, well below the previous one. As for the Step platform, it's another missing opportunity. No relation to President Von Der Leyen's initial announcements to a stand -alone European sovereignty; out of the 10 billion euros requested by the European Parliament, we went to € 1.5 billion, and not a euro additional to the Innovation Fund , the ""Investeu"" program and the ""Horizon Europe"". I wonder why you embellish and vote in favor of this package.","- Mr President, the revision of the multiannual fiscal framework is completely inadequate, and the responsibility is borne by the Council that proves once again a major obstacle, a big brake on the progress of the European Union we cannot ignore, ladies and gentlemen, that this The revision provides cuts in the Horizon Europe programs, the ""EU for Health"", Common Agricultural Policy and Cohesion Policy. Those who criticize these cuts and at the same time vote for this review, are reminiscent of the Catholic monks in the Middle Ages who baptized fish meat to eat it in fasting times. The revised budget, although it is a slight improvement in relation to the existing, is in real terms - if we remove inflation - in 1% of European GDP, well below the previous one.

164489,"- Dear Chairman, Dear Commissioners, Colleagues and Colleagues, we are in the time of pronounced geopolitical challenges and strategic conflicts of global actors if we want to resist it if we want to retain the standard of life in such an environment that Europe has today, we must empower our strategic sovereignty in terms of the economy , in terms of technological competitiveness and in terms of security. More powerful public and private investments in critical sectors are crucial for transition to digital society and green technologies. Proposals such as this, platforms for strategic technology for Europe are quality steps to develop high technologies and digitization faster. It is crucial, first of all, that less, less developed states, less developed parts of Europe have real opportunities when it comes to Step's advantages. Flexibility, on the one hand, as well as alignment with the goals of cohesion policy, is the only way we can provide even even development and encourage investments in strategic sectors across Europe, digital technology, robotics, artificial intelligence and energy. We have a responsibility and we have numerous opportunities that have to feel all our generations in all parts of Europe, as well as to all Member States. In this goal, we will have to rely on our own knowledge, our own resources and our own agility. The fact is that we live today in a cruel era than at the beginning of this term, in an era where no one will give us anything, but we will have to fight for everything ourselves.","- Dear Chairman, Dear Commissioners, Colleagues and Colleagues, we are in the time of pronounced geopolitical challenges and strategic conflicts of global actors if we want to resist it if we want to retain the standard of life in such an environment that Europe has today, we must empower our strategic sovereignty in terms of the economy , in terms of technological competitiveness and in terms of security.

164489,"- Ms. President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues! At Step I have a crying and a laughing eye, because here almost exactly a year ago, Frau von der Leyen stood here at this place and talked about the challenges of the Greens and digital transformation and we applauded when she announced a sovereign fund As a European answer to the efforts and plans of other business powers, this plan had to bury them. Therefore, today we talk about steps - only via step - a small but clever step to support our industry on their way to more strategic autonomy my laughing eye is coming that as a parliament we were able to significantly improve this step proposal. Let me call three aspects: First of all, it is good that we do not introduce any new, unclear terms that would mean even more bureaucracy and research for companies, but we build on existing industrial policy initiatives. Second, the step seal will also attract attention from private investors. As a social democrat, I am glad that we only want to give such projects this seal of quality that also adhere to high social and work standards, because European money should only flow for good jobs in Europe. And thirdly, we have ensured that companies can find out more at a look at all funding opportunities, and thus be able to clear the often defendant funding jungle at a glance. Dear colleagues, Europe has to become strong in strategic technologies. We need a strong solar industry here and not just in China. We need a strong generic industry here and not just in India. And we don't just want to leave the market in artificial intelligence to the US companies. And who knows, maybe next autumn a new commission president will be here and presents a convincing idea of ​​a European sovereign fund to the new European Parliament and stirs us all tears.","- Ms. President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues!

We are calling for a step label that excludes nuclear projects with 100 % clarity, and we should not loot disproportionately cohesion. The fund for a fair transition to pluck as an important EU project that brings competitiveness, decarbonization and social justice together is simply wrong. For competitive green industrial policy, we not only need small, small steps, but also big steps, but above all a strong sovereign fund, preferably today and not tomorrow.","- Mrs. President!

In hollow, the European Commission is mainly trying to pretend to do something in the face of the 400 billion euros in public subsidies from the American.

In a word, what was to be our industrial replica is in fact only a pitiful confession of weakness. An admission of weakness that will end up exasperating net contributory countries, such as France, which are ordered to finance plans of the European Commission if they want to hope for something in return. European strategic sovereignty will not be born in the offices of the Commission, but thanks to the corporate spirit. Less standards, more freedom in state subsidies: this is what our strategic sectors need! In a few months, the future factory of the Safran group will have to be built. When we listen to the managers of this factory, we understand that, instead of building it in the Lyon region, it is now possible that they build it in the United States or Canada. I think this famous STEP plan will not change anything and I think it is above all a big concern for our European industry.","- Madam President, everything is good to claim money from the Member States: this is how we could summarize the new strategy of the European Commission is once again her project, through the Platform Strategic Technologies for Europe that promise us this text?

Everyone knows the situation: you make a transfer, the money is immediately debited from your own account, but it takes at least one, usually two days until the money has also reached the recipient and is the weekend in between, it takes a holiday in between Accordingly longer in the 21st century, there is actually no good reason that the value of the value lasts so long. That is why it is also true that the European legislature intervened here: in the future we will no longer speak of days when transfers, but of seconds. The transition from the classic transfer to Sofortüberweisung is like changing from the post-carriage to the email. With the new regulation, immediate transfers will become the standard in the future, exactly at the same conditions as normal transfers. Today we still have the situation that some banks offer immediate transfers as a premium service and that this service can also be paid well. It will be different in the future. The European legislature has opted for an absolutely consumer-friendly variant, and of course we support this as an EVP parliamentary group. With immediate transfers, we take a very big step towards paying the future. But this also means that we have to consider whether we really need initiatives such as the digital euro for the end customer. The European Central Bank has praised the direct value value of transactions as one of the great advantages, but also that no middlemen, credit card systems or other providers are required. We now also solve all of this with the Sofortüberweisung. That's why I believe that we should talk again about how we should design a digital euro. With this regulation, we have a good argument that we do not need it for the end consumer.","- Ms. President, Ms. Commissioner, dear colleagues, dear colleagues!

We won this so as not to divide the European Union into countries and countries B, showing how the common market should function. Secondly, immediate transfers in euros are to be no more expensive than ordinary transfers in euros available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This is not only convenience for citizens, but also a step towards the strategic autonomy of the Union in financial matters and competition for non -EU credit cards. We helped non -bank institutions in access to banking infrastructure, we fight money laundering, we prevent erroneous transfers. The key is, however, that we have shown that in such a complicated matter, which is finance and banking, the European Union is doing something for a citizen, something that a citizen understands and felt in everyday life.

163746,"- Dear Ms President, Bank Sector in most Member States of the European Union seems to have fallen asleep in some segments to another bank, domestic or foreign, and more days are competing to classic banks, ie modern fintech company, allowing immediate payments to the entire European Union , and even mostly free banks currently do not offer such services mainly because of the lack of competitive pressure, I think. The unwillingness of banks can also be seen that in all countries with the largest share of immediate payments, the initial impulse was coordinated by the central authority, such as the State, the National Bank or the Bank Association. This is an example of a regulation that will benefit consumers. Since the banking sector is regulated at a full -time level, this regulation should also be coordinated in the same space. The measure will also contribute to a more efficient functioning in the single market by deepening competition in the payment market. According to the Commission, the delay of money transfers temporarily blocks EUR 200 billion. The release of this amount will mean an increase in EUR 1.8 billion.","- Dear Ms President, Bank Sector in most Member States of the European Union seems to have fallen asleep in some segments to another bank, domestic or foreign, and more days are competing to classic banks, ie modern fintech company, allowing immediate payments to the entire European Union , and even mostly free banks currently do not offer such services mainly because of the lack of competitive pressure, I think.

164536,"– Mr President, honourable Commissioner, dear colleagues, almost 600 days ago, Russia launched a brutal and murderous attack against the sovereign state of Ukraine Since the very first day of this cold-hearted attack, the European Union has stood by the side of Ukraine, providing EUR 30 billion from the EU budget in support so far The Ukraine Facility will continue this support. It will ensure continuity and predictability of the support for the next three years. EUR 50 billion is a reasonable start for rebuilding Ukraine, but we all know that we will need more in the future. The economic costs of the Russian attack are already now around EUR 270 billion, and the process of rebuilding Ukraine has been estimated to cost around EUR 384 billion. In addition, the psychological toll on the Ukrainian people will be immeasurable. It is of high importance that the facility paves the way for Ukraine to become a member of the European Union. Endorsing the rule of law, as well as other fundamental European values, will create a steady foundation for a stronger Ukraine. It will finally allow for Ukraine’s complete separation from the Russian influence. When implementing the Ukraine Facility, the European Union and Ukraine must ensure that the funds end up with correct beneficiaries. There must be zero tolerance for misuse of EU funds. This is of high importance in order to maintain the legitimacy of the Ukraine support in the eyes of EU citizens. But, as long as this principle is respected, Ukraine can rest assured that the European Union stands by its side as long as it takes.","– Mr President, honourable Commissioner, dear colleagues, almost 600 days ago, Russia launched a brutal and murderous attack against the sovereign state of Ukraine Since the very first day of this cold-hearted attack, the European Union has stood by the side of Ukraine, providing EUR 30 billion from the EU budget in support so far The Ukraine Facility will continue this support. It will ensure continuity and predictability of the support for the next three years. EUR 50 billion is a reasonable start for rebuilding Ukraine, but we all know that we will need more in the future. The economic costs of the Russian attack are already now around EUR 270 billion, and the process of rebuilding Ukraine has been estimated to cost around EUR 384 billion. In addition, the psychological toll on the Ukrainian people will be immeasurable. It is of high importance that the facility paves the way for Ukraine to become a member of the European Union. Endorsing the rule of law, as well as other fundamental European values, will create a steady foundation for a stronger Ukraine. It will finally allow for Ukraine’s complete separation from the Russian influence. When implementing the Ukraine Facility, the European Union and Ukraine must ensure that the funds end up with correct beneficiaries. There must be zero tolerance for misuse of EU funds. This is of high importance in order to maintain the legitimacy of the Ukraine support in the eyes of EU citizens. But, as long as this principle is respected, Ukraine can rest assured that the European Union stands by its side as long as it takes."
164536,"- Mr. Chairman! Mr. Commissioner! Constant and predictable financial assistance for Ukraine is of fundamental importance. The proposal of the Commission is a good starting point. Parliament in the course of its work has enriched this proposal and I hope that our position will meet with understanding from other EU institutions we want to support the current budget needs of Ukraine, its reconstruction and its reconstruction and its reconstruction Preparation for membership in the Union. We allocate a large amount for this. However, we must be aware of the fact that the scale of current budget shortage is colossal and here probably will hit a large part of our help. At the same time, Ukraine may soon lose their ability to take loans at international financial institutions. This means that the financing of reconstruction is becoming illusory at the moment. The damage caused by the Russian aggressor is many times greater than the help we can provide. In this situation, the leading matter is to confiscate Russian state funds frozen in our countries. The claim that this cannot be done legally is false. The aggressor does not use any immunity. Parliament proposes such an action and I appeal to committees and Member States to go in this direction. The reimbursement of the perpetrator of the most severe crime of international law would be an unforgivable mistake. I know that some governments are against confiscation. The reason may be erroneous legal expertise or the pressure of the business fearing confiscation of property by Russia. I would like to point out that Russia has already nationalized the property of Western companies with a value of tens of billions of euros on its own initiative. Let's finally be firm. Delaying with a decision is a way to failure.","- Mr. Chairman! Mr. Commissioner! Constant and predictable financial assistance for Ukraine is of fundamental importance.

164536,"; - Dear President of the meeting, Commission Mary, dear Ukrainians, colleagues and colleagues. Today is 600 days when Russian aggressors systematically destroy the country's infrastructure, kill the people of Ukraine and commit other terrible war crimes. Russia's war against Ukraine and its price is enormous. It will take decades to recover from the country and its economy. The European Union's decision to develop a long Ukrainian support program of 2024-2027 is a truly welcome step. This is clearly confirmed by the solidarity of our policy towards Ukraine, so these are real real actions. It is important for all of us to enable the Ukrainian support program to be fundamentally modernized in the country's economy, increases energy efficiency and eventually leads to the growth of people's income. I emphasize that the full -fledged and responsible involvement of the Ukrainian side of the Government - Verkhovna Rados - is necessary, as well as the involvement of socio -economic partners. The Ukrainian instrument is a really good example of the European Union and Ukrainian partnership. This is the path forward. The restoration of the economic potential of Ukraine and the progress of society will become the best symbol of the Russian imperial defeat.

They gradually free - and above all their lake access. Odessa's ports are almost freely accessible, cereals are exported, the Russian fleet has been submerged. Ukraine naturally defends its own, but also our freedom in the EU. Every cent that we invest in Ukraine is the best money invested in democracy and our security. The new Ukraine facility-a 50 billion aid-will help the Ukrainians not only survive, but also to rebuild the country. It should get better and greener. The Ukraine of the future will be a model for everyone else. We have ensured that the Ukraine of the future will be determined by its population, which is represented by its government, its parliament, its civil society and its communities. It is the people who decide what the Ukraine of tomorrow will look like. Since the European taxpayers should know how their money is spent, we have equipped the Ukraine facility with extensive transparency. This ensures that a cent invested in the country can be accounted for. The facility for Ukraine is also a forerunner for the state's EU membership. It offers a perfect synergy between reconstruction and reforms. With our joint efforts, the free, united democratic Ukraine will be the green engine of the European future.

I live near the border with Ukraine and I know perfectly well what drama is playing there, I often hear planes flying over Ukraine and landing in Rzeszów to help Ukraine and of course we support all those actions that aim to help Ukraine to see Ukraine in the European Union in the future It is obvious to me, however, we are opposing the multiplication of requirements at the moment when it comes to Ukraine, as well as the so -called greenness of various types of investments, Ukrainians need bread, water, work, and not problems related to ecology for this time, you also need to help Ukrainians in the Ukrainians in combating corruption. This is a big problem and this country must deal with it if it wants to be in the future in the European Union. We are talking about large money for Ukraine, about 50 billion euros - this is ok. We are talking about loans, we are talking about subsidies. I am sure that it will be in total subsidies, because Ukraine's GDP is currently -106 %. They will not even have anything to pay off this borrowed money from. In connection with the above, we definitely talk as a group of European conservatives and reformers for reliable analysis of help for Ukraine and for reliable information on how much funds and when we have already given Ukraine, because these corruption situations are quite difficult there. Ukraine is fighting, also on behalf of the European Union. We hope that Ukraine will simply win this war, and the European Union will help it in this war. As a side note, of course, I want to mention not to formulate very unpleasant and false information about Ukraine, and at all about what is happening on the outskirts of Ukraine. Elections were held in Poland yesterday. Manfred Weber said forty minutes ago that Donald Tusk won this election. This is not true, ladies and gentlemen, it is such black information. The Citizen Platform coalition, i.e. the Donald Tusk party, won 28% of votes, Law and Justice, the Law and Justice party for today, for now won 38%.

164536,"– Mr President, Commissioner, the 50 billion Ukraine facility is a rushed, inadequate mechanism tailor-made for corruption and embezzlement of EU funds on a massive scale There are simply not enough measures in the proposal to mitigate the threats posed by the rampant high-level corruption in Ukraine Ukraine is, to quote Jean-Claude Juncker, ‘corrupt at all levels of society’. Read any European Court of Auditors report on Ukraine and find similar conclusions. They document a complete lack of value for money in terms of reforms, and any progress achieved with EU funds is constantly under threat. In their opinion on the facility, they say the proposal fails to demonstrate how the risks will be mitigated. Oligarchs and vested interests across Ukraine are the root cause of corruption and obstacle to economic development in the country. The facility has no provision to exclude companies under oligarch influence from receiving support. We are constructing a colonial debt trap for Ukraine, facilitating more destruction as we continue to fuel the war and further theft of lands and assets by Western capital. I’m in favour of helping Ukraine, but you’re not going to help them with more debt. Two thirds of the money is debt. You’re going to kill them with that. How are they going to pay it back? They won’t pay it back in the next 50 years. But what it will mean is that we’re colonising the place. It is bad enough we have Western companies now that have bought up more land at a fire-sale price than the Russians have taken on the east side. What is wrong with us? We’re going to take their land and we’re going to take their workers for cheap labour for western European countries. We’re going to pauperise the place. We’re creating a bleak future for the people of Ukraine.","– Mr President, Commissioner, the 50 billion Ukraine facility is a rushed, inadequate mechanism tailor-made for corruption and embezzlement of EU funds on a massive scale There are simply not enough measures in the proposal to mitigate the threats posed by the rampant high-level corruption in Ukraine Ukraine is, to quote Jean-Claude Juncker, ‘corrupt at all levels of society’.

167680,"– Mr President, I’d like to thank the Commission for their proposal here and thank you to our rapporteur and the other shadows for their work bringing us to this point So this Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive will mandate countries to step up their efforts in removing harmful micro-pollutants. And we know that there is growing concern from consumers and from our citizens about the rising level of these pollutants in our waterways. It’s one of the most significant overhauls in EU water policy in over 30 years, and it does form the cornerstone of the EU zero-pollution package. The revision focuses on tackling new pollution threats, increasing the availability and transparency of pollution data, and requiring countries across Europe to alert each other about pollution events. This proposal will also see the wastewater treatment plants across Europe becoming energy-neutral by 2040, contributing to our Green Deal ambitions. So it’s a crucial new piece of legislation reducing pollution and improving water quality in European lakes, rivers and coastal areas and will significantly benefit our environment while improving the well-being and the health of our citizens. And it will be challenging for many areas, given the difficult terrain and also the scattering of our population settlements. So as part of the new legislative proposal, Member States, including Ireland, will now have to remove micro-pollutants from urban wastewater as well as routinely monitor for pathogens such as COVID-19. The principle of the polluter pays has been introduced here, and I welcome that. Up to 92% of the pollutants do come from pharmaceuticals, and the cosmetic industry has been identified by the Commission. I think we have reached a balance in our proposal as to how we move forward in this area, because we do need ambitious, pragmatic laws to continue to improve Europe’s water quality, and that exactly is what this legislation will do. So I welcome it and hope we’ll be moving on to the next stage and look forward to working again with my rapporteur and with the other institutions.","– Mr President, I’d like to thank the Commission for their proposal here and thank you to our rapporteur and the other shadows for their work bringing us to this point So this Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive will mandate countries to step up their efforts in removing harmful micro-pollutants.

The Commission's proposal was actually fine and it has made our work much easier but there was still room for improvement, and we have managed to get through with a lot of important points: on the whole we have been able to preserve, even raising The level of ambition We have received more attention to reducing energy consumption, increasing energy efficiency, and utilizing surplus heat as well as ensuring a greater focus on methane and nitrous oxide, and thus the necessity of climate neutrality in the long term We have also strengthened the contribution to the circular economy both in relation to nutrients and water, and we have gained extra focus on the problems of microplastics and PFAS, and we have improved the administration and cooperation between Member States and the Commission, the harmonization with relevant environmental legislation and stricter the requirements for openness but unfortunately something has also been deteriorating. We are green pretty concerned about that. Firstly, we think it is strange that the polluter-paying principle in Article 9 will be diluted. The Commission's proposal to finance the purification of polluting micro -victims through an expanded producer responsibility was the right way to go. It is only fair that the affected sectors are involved, and they are thus not poor. The pharmaceutical industry e.g. have good advice. We are also disappointed that up to 25 percent of the area's energy neutrality should be able to be obtained from the electricity grid. There is already heavy demand for green power, and if we are to reach climate neutrality, all sectors should settle in selenium. It is also not okay that there are proposals to raise the limit for the size of cities that must be obliged to cleanse micro pollution, cf. Article 8. This will mean far more pollution in a number of half -sized cities. And then I have to mention a very bizarre amendment to the 253 that will exempt a particular country from having to remove nutrients, citing that an area is vulnerable to the extra pollution. Excuse me! All EU citizens have the right to live in a healthy environment, even if it requires extra effort!","- HR chairman! Thanks to Nils and to the colleagues for a good collaboration!

The oxygen lets up the seas die Life in our streams is gone it sounds like a horror movie, but it is the reality of Europe today our aquatic environment is in deep crisis Life in our lakes, streams and sea areas need to be restored Therefore more need to be connected to the sewer system more wastewater should cleaned and we need to introduce a new fourth cleansing step, which also removes micro pollution but who has to pay for it? Of course, it must be those who pollute who else? When the pharmaceutical and cosmetics giants are responsible for the vast majority of the particles we remove in the fourth cleaning step, it is also only reasonable for them to pay the bill but here we have the conflict right now It is clear that the right wing, and unfortunately also The Social Democrats would rather wipe the bill on the taxpayers by giving the pharmaceutical industry a discount on the bill sorry, but it does not last!

167680,"- Mr. Chairman! The 1991 municipal wastewater treatment directive should be changed a long time ago, thanks to this review, we strive to a high level of environmental and health standards while maintaining the achievement and accessibility of the directive, first of all, we want our waters to be clean and the sewage is cleaned better, and now thanks to 4 The level of purification. Harmful micro -cleansing will be removed from the 4 -level cleansing system is an example of the necessary modification, but the amount of costs cannot be transferred directly to citizens through the extended water bill, the manufacturer's liability system must play here the main role in accordance with the ""pollutant principle"" we also need financial support. At the level of the European Union, to spread the costs and leave no one behind, because the water does not know the boundaries of plastic microdrobine is another challenge that we identified, and we asked to find tools that will keep them away from our water and food, secondly, according to With our goals of climate neutrality, we want the sewage treatment industry to become energy neutral, like all other sectors of our lives. To do this achievable and realistic at this stage, we call for the production of green energy at the sewage purification site, as well as for the joint production of energy by the owners and operators of municipal sewage treatment plants. In addition, in the event of a proven necessity, it will be possible to obtain up to 25% renewable energy from external sources. But the goal of climate neutrality must be achieved at the end. We deeply believe that European Union citizens have the right to a clean environment, and we are obliged to provide them.","- Mr. Chairman!

166879,"- Dear Chairman, Vice -President of the European Commission, Colleagues, several decades ago, Europe had a leading position in health research and innovation, but today, despite some exceptions, the vast majority of innovation and innovative companies are found elsewhere we have to turn this trend and return Innovations in Europe and create an environment that attracts, and does not create obstacles for new remedies manufacturers. Patients' access to EU drugs and supply safety are also increasing reasons for concern. Due to all of the above, the depth reform of the current legislation was required, which last changed more seriously 20 years ago. The main goal of the reform is to ensure that all patients in the EU have an equal and faster access to effective drugs, no matter where they live. So we shorten the time needed to issue a medication approval by the European Medicines Agency. Also, we allow medicines to be delivered to patients at any time, no matter where they live in the Union. The new remedy will now have to be put on the market of all Member States who request this. Certainly the fight against antimicrobial resistance should be mentioned, since pharmaceutical companies are further encouraged to develop new antibiotics, a combination of different measures that include vouchers and public subsidies. In the regulation where I worked in recent months, we have also adopted provisions to facilitate research into the development of the approval of medicines for rare diseases, the area where research is most needed and the most risky investments. This is especially important for 95 percent of patients with rare diseases for whom there is no cure today, which we absolutely need to change. Also, I would like to point out that we expand the area of ​​the application of the so -called Bolar exemption, which will allow generic drugs to come to the European market significantly earlier than before, which is extremely important for our citizens. We strengthen the market competition with measures to encourage early entry into the market of generic drugs, allow patients with easier access, and reduced health systems. Ladies and gentlemen, with this reform, strengthen the European industry, facilitate access to innovative drugs, but also generic drugs, and allow all patients to have the same status and that no other citizens of the second order. For these reasons, please support this reform.","- Dear Chairman, Vice -President of the European Commission, Colleagues, several decades ago, Europe had a leading position in health research and innovation, but today, despite some exceptions, the vast majority of innovation and innovative companies are found elsewhere we have to turn this trend and return Innovations in Europe and create an environment that attracts, and does not create obstacles for new remedies manufacturers.

And demands transparency, also regarding public funds received by pharmaceutical companies. In a debate marked by strong external pressure, I want to make a reflection. An incorrect message has been repeated: there is no need to choose between improving pharmaceutical innovation in Europe or making medications more accessible and affordable. This dichotomy does not exist if we apply the appropriate policies. The health budget is limited. That is why we firmly oppose that the money of our patients financial innovation outside of Europe. The socialists will continue to put solutions to support research and Pharmaceutical innovation in Europe and, at the same time, we will continue to fight unacceptable inequalities. The postal code should not determine which drugs or what treatments people receive, or even those who do not receive. I think this agreement, what we are going to vote today, is a good principle, but we are clear this is not the end. We must remain ambitious. We have to protect the general interest of health over the interest of economic operators. It is clear that this will continue to be the objective of the S&D group in this debate.","- Mrs. President, Mr. Commissioner, today we vote the reform of the pharmaceutical policy of the European Union with deep socialist brands has only guided me, has guided us the general interest: to improve the problems we have in Europe of accessibility to innovation or industrial drugs The final text favors innovation and access, encourages investment in the treatment of diseases such as rare diseases and the development of new antimicrobials, and, of course, leads to improving and protecting clinical research that our doctors and our researchers do in The hospitals, thanks, for example, to hospital exemption in advanced therapies, so unique in my country.

We have also managed to combat drug shortages, limit the negative impact on the drug production environment, and also send an important signal for Hera to finally become an independent European Union agency. To accelerate our fight against antimicrobial resistance, we have managed to strengthen the ""one health"" approach, while maintaining attractiveness for development and innovation in Europe. So I encourage everyone to support the position of the European Parliament. Together, we can build a pharmaceutical policy based on ideals of equity, transparency, sustainability and centered on the patient.","- Madam President, the Commissioner, the revision of pharmaceutical legislation was not easy, but I am convinced that we have managed to find a good compromise in the interest of patients and health systems by reaching this Compromise, we have managed to improve the accessibility of drugs, to ensure transparency of public investments in pharmaceutical research and development.

168309,"- Ms. President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues! In the past few months we have intensively negotiated about this parliamentary mandate for the revision of the air quality directive. That is why, together with colleagues from other political groups, we presented a whole package of change proposals. It is about continuing the ambitious goals of the European Union and continuing the successes that we have achieved in the past with regard to improving air quality. But it is also a question that we do not take unrealistic and drastic measures such as driving bans or the decommissioning of industries, such as the S&D and parts of the liberals, left and the Greens. The solution should clearly be called: create incentives, promote low -emission opportunities - instead of bans and punishments. We also have to keep in mind that there is already a very high standard in many member states in terms of air quality. This revision must therefore weigh up the costs and the effort with the result in a proportionality. For me, the red line is to request the adaptation of the WHO values ​​over the next ten years. Approach to the WHO values ​​yes, adjustment no. The emphasis is on the guideline. These values ​​should not be misunderstood as limit values. Because the WHO itself emphasizes that its guidelines only reflect the most optimal state of health. As a decision -maker, we therefore have to harmonize all facets of health, environment and economy within the EU and decide what speed this transformation should be in place. Therefore, I advertise to accept the emission values ​​of the commission proposal for 2035.","- Ms. President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues!

With the revision of European Union guidelines on air quality, we have a unique opportunity and at the same time responsibility to further reduce the impact on human health and ecosystems. We should not let the right agenda of inactivity be imposed. We have to follow the dictates of science. The European Union's air quality standards must be fully aligned and as quickly as possible with the guidelines of the World Health Organization. We cannot make discounts on human health. We do not represent company shareholders here. We are elected representatives of citizens. We must therefore shield the framework for implementation and compliance so that Member States take the necessary measures to comply with pollutants under the marginal values, but also to act rapidly to maintain periods of overrun to a minimum, limiting health effects. We must put an end to the provisions that allow Member States to postpone the application of the rules. And finally, proper application means accountability.

168481,"- Mr. President! Mr. Commissioner It has already been three years since the Commission presented its action plan for circular economy and we here in the European Parliament prepared our initiative report since then we have taken clear steps to achieve our climate goals, and now we also show that we deliver on the transition to one more Circular economy. It is a great success and I would like to thank the rapporteur Moretti and my shadow colleagues for good cooperation, and because we have reached an agreement. There is great uncertainty in Europe, both politically and economically. Then it is especially important to ensure and maintain the support we have received from the voters for our environmental policy. This means that we have to think carefully about how we implement it. Clear frames are the way forward, not detail management. For companies, the most important thing is quite simple: everyone wants the opportunity to compete on equal terms. I think we have given them the tools to use what is one of our most important assets, namely the European internal market. Our internal market is one of our Union's greatest strengths. Unfortunately, we do not fully use it and use the entire potential. Sometimes we can even undermine its functionality. Removing internal obstacles to trade and growth has therefore been one of my most important priorities. But we have also made brand new suggestions on the table, not least in terms of tougher holds to encourage more sustainable value chains both within textiles and on the electronics page. With these rules, I believe that European industry on equal terms will have the opportunity to change. With this proposal, we are on the right path to create an EU market for sustainable products. It's the right way to go.","- Mr. President!

I also approached this fragment of legislation with this attitude. I worked on this ekoprojekt as a counterparty in the internal market and consumer protection committee. And I am glad that we managed to improve this good commission proposal in several aspects, make it a little better. And I will mention only two points. First of all - what many were waiting for - we clearly indicate that the requirements in the field of eco -project should relate to the introduction of a common charger to similar products, e.g. gardening tools, electric drills or products that must be protected against moisture or water, such as toothbrushes, such as toothbrushes, shaver etc. And we like specifics. Secondly, the end of paper books, instructions that have always been attached in ten languages ​​to all products. The instructions will be easily available in digital format and printed only at the consumer's request. In this way we will save millions of trees and I hope that we will vote for these changes tomorrow, and the Commission and the Council will support these proposals.","- Mr. Chairman!

168481,"- Mr. President, honorable colleagues, the objective of the regulation on eco -compatible design would be to reduce the environmental impact of the products during their life cycle but, once again, it ends in the end to impose further charges to businesses and lays the bases For future new initiatives, with important dangers for companies we appreciate the references to micro, small and medium -sized enterprises, but we still have many doubts about this proposal. One, among all, the non -inclusion of the recycling between the exemptions in the definition of destruction, practically reused and reversal. In short, according to the proposal, recycling would be a way of destruction of the product. This is an absurdity that would affect Italian companies in different sectors that have been investing in recycling for years - consider that Italy is first in the world in recycling - and we consider it a paradox. In practice, luxury brands are also affected to attack fashion companies: it is a paradox that companies like Armani, if they have an invented dress, cannot destroy it but cannot even recycle it. It should disassemble the luxury market, which only in Italy is worth 17 billion euros and 78% of luxury fashion is. We have presented an amendment that introduces the requirement of information on the origin of the product, so that it can be recognized and therefore valued as excellence, but also in this case the left, of course, will be absolutely contrary. We have read 130 pages of rules and constraints for companies. In addition, among other things, in this regulation it is decided to give power to the Commission to introduce further requirements and obligations through specific delegated acts or legislative documents. We remain against. You continue to carry out regulations and proposals that will not save the world, but rather they will make Europe less competitive than the other competitors. It's not worth it.","- Mr. President, honorable colleagues, the objective of the regulation on eco -compatible design would be to reduce the environmental impact of the products during their life cycle but, once again, it ends in the end to impose further charges to businesses and lays the bases For future new initiatives, with important dangers for companies we appreciate the references to micro, small and medium -sized enterprises, but we still have many doubts about this proposal.

But we also need these technical solutions. I personally was very impressed when I was explained to me for the first time - how to work - it is already possible today to remove CO2 from the air and produce products from them. It is of course infinitely expensive, but how expensive was photovoltaics in the 90s, and today it is almost unrivaled. That is why we have to start promoting this technology as soon as possible, and I think that at least this technology should also be included in the European emission trade as soon as possible. So a clear signal: We need the negative emissions as soon as possible, and we need incentives for everyone who invests in this area.","- President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues!

166844,"- Dear President, thank you very much and congratulations again! Dear Commissioner, nice to see you again! Dear Colleagues! First I would like to thank Lídia, our rapporteur, for the great cooperation, for the many meetings that we had together, I think that was very constructive work that we did here across the parliamentary group boundaries and thus create good framework legislation I am really sure that when we vote on it, creating a good framework with this law, the carbon in the European Union regulates and that we need clear rules for this, all experts are very united. The world climate also says it: Without negative emissions, our climate goals cannot be created - even if we completely decarbonize energy generation when the industry is completely changed. We will always have areas where emissions continue to arise, and therefore the negative emissions are so important - both technological withdrawals and natural withdrawals. And at the same time, we have had to experience in recent years that a lot of greenwashing was operated with the carbon withdrawals - with which - an incredible amount of shinds was driven. The collapse of the certificate by Verra shows this very clearly: it urgently needs strict and good rules, which we present with the present proposal from the environmental committee. We create a standard, on the basis of which companies, engineers, but also our farmers can also establish sustainable business models, and we also create with this standard. This trust must be. I think we have to ensure that with every removal the restoration of biodiversity is actively supported - we do. We have to prevent monocultures and short-term take-use effects, and in the end we also have to ensure that when using biomass in combination with CO2 storage, which we also call BECCS, we need clear rules. All emissions, including those from land use, must be included, so that the need for biomass does not continue to increase. I am very excited about the vote and thank you again for the constructive cooperation and I'm already looking forward to the trilogue.","- Dear President, thank you very much and congratulations again!

166844,"– Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues, to achieve our climate targets, we need three things: we need drastic cuts in emissions; we need drastic increase of carbon removals; and we need viable businesses and farmers that can remove and sequester carbon from the atmosphere These two final points have so far been neglected a lot in the EU climate agenda, but that ends now. That’s why I’m really proud of what we are doing here. As far as I know, this is the world’s first law in certifying carbon removals – with this proposal, with clear business opportunities for the companies and farmers who are doing the right things. That’s why I am so proud standing here today as Renew shadow of this file. Because this text is very much influenced by the Renew proposals. We are increasing the climate integrity as well as creating competitiveness for our companies. But colleagues, this is only the first steps. We are not done. This is only certifying the carbon removals. The next steps is creating the market, boosting the market, stimulating the carbon removals that we much need in order to fulfil our climate agenda.

We are really in the midst of a climate crisis now - a climate disaster and it is no longer just enough to quickly reduce emissions we must also develop techniques that remove coal from the atmosphere, store it in the agricultural land and in our forests but should we do it so must We also do it for real. In principle, the Commission's proposal is based on companies being able to compensate their emissions by purchasing themselves with the help of certificates from carbon storage. It is not enough, and we have also managed to stop that. The result of the Environment Committee is quite okay. It's not perfect, but it's something to work on. Therefore, I am really urging you now to put a stop to these completely absurd proposals from the conservative part of the agricultural committee. For example, that agricultural activities should be able to be certified just as it is conducted today without having to do anything more to increase the carbon storage. It is not only wrong, it is also to disappoint all the farmers, all the planet nurses who are in Europe who actually want and can do something - much, much more - to really increase our opportunities to reach our climate goals.

Creating, capturing carbon dioxide is very important that you have to pay for it, encourage that this simply happens, unfortunately, this document does not respond to these needs, because it builds a system in an absolute legal vacuum. Roughly we say that somehow it will be that the market will determine that farmers, foresters are interested because they will perform various types of activities that they will perform anyway, and for it they will get money. Unfortunately, if this system is not tied with ETS, that is, we will not reduce buying permissions by buying certificates of capturing and absorbing carbon dioxide, we will simply create ETS 3, which will absolutely function on the market without any control. It bodes badly. I hope that during subsequent work you will be able to work out secure documents.","- Mr. Chairman! Nice to see, Lord, Commissioner!

Because this text is the first step towards the integration of the agricultural world into the European carbon market, one of the last sectors to resist it.

163765,"- Mr. President, Dear Ms. Commissioner, dear colleagues, dear colleagues! The dossier, about which we advise today, is part of the package for road traffic safety, and in this respect I think it is unhappy that we do not advise and coordinate the guideline on the union -wide effect on certain decisions about the loss of driving authorization with the driving license guideline because it would actually be It made sense to treat the package together, and I find it unfortunate that some factions have prevented the basic idea of ​​the present proposal here is simple and understandable: a driver commits a serious traffic offense, such as: B. Extreme speed overruns, driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs as well as traffic offenses with death or serious bodily harm, where the driver is to blame, the driver should also lose his driver's license in the entire European Union. It's about road traffic safety. According to the applicable regulations, a severe road traffic offense that leads to withdrawal of the driver's license cannot be enforced across the EU if the offense was committed in another Member State than where the driver's license was issued. Nobody can actually explain that this is still possible today. That is why this is an important proposal that we as a European People's Party also support and which we want to treat quickly. But we have to be careful not to overlay the whole thing with non -material things. First, we should not demand a European point system here. That makes no sense, and as a European People's Party we will not support that. This raises a number of legal questions, and those who always work for the rule of law should also consider EU law and not demand something like this.

It's a shame that this is probably only possible in the next legislative period.","- Mr. President, Dear Ms. Commissioner, dear colleagues, dear colleagues! The dossier, about which we advise today, is part of the package for road traffic safety, and in this respect I think it is unhappy that we do not advise and coordinate the guideline on the union -wide effect on certain decisions about the loss of driving authorization with the driving license guideline because it would actually be It made sense to treat the package together, and I find it unfortunate that some factions have prevented the basic idea of ​​the present proposal here is simple and understandable: a driver commits a serious traffic offense, such as: B. Extreme speed overruns, driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs as well as traffic offenses with death or serious bodily harm, where the driver is to blame, the driver should also lose his driver's license in the entire European Union. It's about road traffic safety. According to the applicable regulations, a severe road traffic offense that leads to withdrawal of the driver's license cannot be enforced across the EU if the offense was committed in another Member State than where the driver's license was issued. Nobody can actually explain that this is still possible today. That is why this is an important proposal that we as a [GROUP] also support and which we want to treat quickly. But we have to be careful not to overlay the whole thing with non -material things. First, we should not demand a European point system here. That makes no sense, and as a [GROUP] we will not support that. This raises a number of legal questions, and those who always work for the rule of law should also consider EU law and not demand something like this. Second, we want the Member States to handle it seriously. We could have been ready long ago if the council moved. It's a shame that this is probably only possible in the next legislative period."
163765,"- Mr. President, Mrs. curator, to achieve the objective of the ""zero vision"", that is, zero victims and serious injuries on European roads in 2050, it is necessary to take decisive measures since 2010 the creation of a European road safety space It has been one of the objectives of the European Union aimed at that ""zero vision."" And one of the main elements of that European Road Safety Area is the one that deals with the proposal that we debate today: the reciprocal recognition of the deprivation of the right to conduct. This proposal aims to end the situation of impunity of those drivers who commit serious offenses outside their countries and to which it is difficult to properly sanction. Therefore, it is of great importance not only for tourist countries, such as Spain, Portugal, Italy, but also for those countries in central Europe with higher traffic flows in transit. We advance in the good direction with the creation of a system of cooperation and exchange of information on procedures related to infractions. But we should not only cooperate when the most serious infractions occur: penalties. It would be necessary to encourage member states to also cooperate with respect to administrative. It is not understood that a driver comet repeated infractions in another country and that, for not becoming criminal, it does not suppose any sanction for the lack of collaboration between countries. And, finally, it would be very positive to be implemented at European level driving licensing system - as we have in Spain, which has given so good results - and in which all infractions were included, regardless in which they are committed. Thank you, Petar, for your report. Without decisive measures we will never reach ""zero vision"" and this report will help it.","- Mr. President, Mrs. curator, to achieve the objective of the ""zero vision"", that is, zero victims and serious injuries on European roads in 2050, it is necessary to take decisive measures since 2010 the creation of a European road safety space It has been one of the objectives of the European Union aimed at that ""zero vision.""

163765,"- Mr. President, Mrs. Commissioner, this directive advances in the principle that our union is a shared space of freedom and security will save many lives every year, because it will prevent a driver from sanctioning in a member state with the loss of the driving license It can legally circulate in another state because we are not able to share this information, the withdrawal of the card will have immediate effect in all member states when due speed, drunken driving or under the effects of drugs or committing Infractions that carry serious body deaths or lesions is a long claim claimed by organizations such as Stop accidents The end of this scope of impunity will be completed with other rules that will allow data to be shared and make the traffic fines effective throughout the union . They are fundamentally economic sanctions that have demonstrated their deterrent capacity over unconscious drivers or with trends or reckless hobbies. We are, consequently, before a legislative package that will improve road safety throughout the Union, but I am especially glad the impact it will have on cross -border areas. The traffic police patrol in these areas are attesting that the conduct of their most reckless nationals is very different in the border state than the one they observe in their own. The offenders know that this lack of cooperation turns their tuition into a Corsican patent. And generate avoidable risks that cost many lives every year. This is also to build Europe.","- Mr. President, Mrs. Commissioner, this directive advances in the principle that our union is a shared space of freedom and security will save many lives every year, because it will prevent a driver from sanctioning in a member state with the loss of the driving license It can legally circulate in another state because we are not able to share this information, the withdrawal of the card will have immediate effect in all member states when due speed, drunken driving or under the effects of drugs or committing Infractions that carry serious body deaths or lesions is a long claim claimed by organizations such as Stop accidents The end of this scope of impunity will be completed with other rules that will allow data to be shared and make the traffic fines effective throughout the union .

Especially because up to 40% of cross -border offenses remain impunity today. Every citizen of the European Union and also in Lisbon, Tallin and Copenhagen or in Slovak Svidník should be sure that in his town there is no driver who was forbidden to drive, for example, in Amsterdam, Rome or Warsaw for driving under under the ride under For example, the influence of alcohol twice as high as it was allowed. This proposal will increase road safety throughout the European Union, reduce material damage and save health and human lives. All this at very low cost. We rarely see such projects.

Then the question immediately arises: What does the EU ask for next? A union -wide adjustment of criminal law? That would be just a further step towards the establishment of the United States of Europe, and I will reject this goal. So it would make sense to revise this draft again. I cannot agree in the current form, and that's why we have also brought in a rejection, because the present draft undermines the legal sovereignty of the Member States.

168424,"- Chairman, is there a crack in your smartphone screen, does water leak out of your washing machine or does your vacuum cleaner look broken? We have experienced all this and it is very annoying when products break, we quickly replace them by buying new ones. But there are of course also cheaper and more environmentally friendly alternatives. Namely repair. And with this new law it becomes easier, cheaper and more sustainable to repair broken products. How are we going to do this? Among other things by stimulating the repair market. More spare parts will also be available. It should also become more attractive for repair cafés and small -scale repairers to just do their work. No more unnecessary administration, because by repairing more, we ensure that products last longer and reduces the amount of waste. And it's good for your wallet. In this way we all save a lot of money, we pay attention to the environment and we encourage companies to deal with products more sustainably. And your oh-so-loved smartphone, washing machine or vacuum cleaner? It is as good as new again.","- Chairman, is there a crack in your smartphone screen, does water leak out of your washing machine or does your vacuum cleaner look broken?

168424,"- Ms. President, dear colleagues! Over 70% of people in Europe want to repair their smartphone, but only 20% do it - that is a gestated chance to finally repair it easier, cheaper and faster, the protective resources and the climate, and that is exactly what makes European law on repair What does that mean specifically for consumers? If the vacuum cleaner breaks, it no longer has to go directly into the trash, because the manufacturer has to repair the vacuum cleaner. In order for the repair to be affordable, independent little ones around the corner or tinkerers should also have access to instructions and spare parts at home, at a reasonable price. This is very important, because repairing is currently far too expensive. We Greens have successfully negotiated that practices are prevented that use the manufacturers to keep the thumb on the repair, e.g. B. that certain spare parts can only be used with serial number. All of this is the end of the undisputed market power of Apple and Co. and will bring new jobs and new orders for the little ones - and that is really good. Repairing is no longer a luxury, but becomes a norm, because the right to repair finally enables consumers to choose. I say very clearly: We Greens would have liked more; We Greens would have z. B. gladly adapted to the lifespan. That would have triggered a real repair revolution, but unfortunately that was prevented by center law in this house. Nevertheless: The current compromise is also a milestone in the transition to the circular economy and protects resources and climate, also the wallet of consumers.

168424,"– Madam President, Commissioner, the right to repair – rather than the alternative to throw away or to replace something – that is going to be absolutely welcomed by consumers, not just because of a cost-saving measure, but also, importantly, because of the positive impact on our environment It is estimated that EU consumers lose up to EUR 12 billion each year by opting to buy new goods instead of repairing, and the option to repair is not always available. This legislation will remove those obstacles by ensuring that products can be repaired within the legal guarantee, that consumers have easier and cheaper options to repair goods when the guarantee is expired, that strong provisions will be in place to ensure independent repairers can easily repair products without restrictions by the manufacturers. This will be supported by provisions to ensure affordable spare parts that are there available, that manufacturers must disclose repair details and offer spare parts and tools at fair prices. Consumer awareness is to be facilitated through a new European online repair system, allowing them to locate repair facilities in their own State. And, of course, another major benefit of this legislation must be the impact on our environment: less waste, less use of limited natural resources. The Commission figures tell us that 261 million tonnes of CO2-equivalent emissions are generated each year by the loss of electronic waste, resulting in 35 million tonnes of waste in the EU every year. So this proposal will address those challenges, be a major contributor to our sustainability, to our circular economy, and ensure the consumers have more money in their pockets.","– Madam President, Commissioner, the right to repair – rather than the alternative to throw away or to replace something – that is going to be absolutely welcomed by consumers, not just because of a cost-saving measure, but also, importantly, because of the positive impact on our environment It is estimated that EU consumers lose up to EUR 12 billion each year by opting to buy new goods instead of repairing, and the option to repair is not always available.

Yes, it is always hassle to get your product repaired and at the same time, so you do not know what the consequence is, and it is quite so annoying every year every year the citizens of Europe spend 12 billion euros replacing the products that In fact, could have been repaired and every year more than 35 million tonnes of waste ends up at Europe's landfills because of this, and therefore we are in the process of improving this in Europe now fortunately it will be easier for European consumers to repair Instead of buying new. It's good for your purse and it's good for our globe. Because we consumers, we want to make a sustainable choice and repair our defective products, but it just has to be easier and it will be now. And that is why I would like to start by saying a big thank you to our rapporteur on the case, René Repasi, who has done a huge job to make sure we have been given this new law. I want to highlight especially three things that I think are good. First, we ensure that spare parts are more easily accessible and the price must be reasonable. Prices and accessibility must not stand in the way of being able to repair. Secondly, we ensure that repair is what you take in the starting point. If a product is broken, then repair should preferably be the first way. So replacing the product must in fact be the last resort. And thirdly, we introduce what I think is quite crucial, namely an extended 12 -month warranty on products that will be repaired again. It will provide increased security for consumers. So the next time the washing machine gets off at the worst possible time, then you have a better opportunity to have it repaired. It is good for us consumers, and it is especially good for our globe. Huge thanks for the legislation we get now.","- Mrs. Chairman!

Supporting plans that make Europe safer, freer and more prosperous that can make life easier such as this guideline, the right to repair products can therefore be repaired cheaper and easier and if all goes well, it will also be better for our earth and the world to We are especially important that people in the Netherlands and Europe can trust that we make their lives easier and safer and that we make good laws. This guideline is an example of this. It is especially important that we always have an eye for the people, who want them to be able to trust us and that we take steps.

168424,"- Ms. President, dear colleagues! Nowhere does the EU arrive as specifically with people as in consumer protection. We improve the lives of almost 450 million people: we combat greenwashing and electronic waste, we have abolished the roaming fees and introduced the uniform charging cable and everyone now benefits from it. Repairs start, and the end of unnecessary resource consumption is that we can repair our cell phones, laptops and washing machines easier, faster and cheaper in the future. We rolled out the carpet to the circular economy. We change how we do business. We make sustainability a worthwhile business model. Consumers benefit most from this. This shows again: The European Green Deal is a success story - for a better everyday life of people, for the planet, for the predictability of companies. Therefore we must not hollow it out or stop it. No, we have to continue the green deal. Last but not least, European consumers want that.","- Ms. President, dear colleagues!

168424,"- Mrs. President! I would like to thank the rapporteur Mr. René Repasi for the joint work, which we performed in parliament, for effective negotiations during three -sided conversations, the effect of this cooperation is a text that ensures optimal benefits for consumers and minimal burdens for entrepreneurs, new regulations mean easier and more available repairs for all consumers, Which in turn will contribute to the extension of the life of products such as washing machines, dishwashers, refrigerators, vacuum cleaners or electronic displays now, when our home appliances are defective, they are often just thrown away, because the parts are expensive or there is no one at all this directive is also A great chance for independent repair services, thanks to ensuring wide access to spare parts and facilitating the provision of these services cross services. Our economy will gain. I particularly see new opportunities for Polish entrepreneurs here, because we have long had a culture of repairing devices. Time to use our strengths and free this potential. I would also like to emphasize my satisfaction with the fact that in the final shape the directive will actually be the right to repair, not coercion, because the original proposal of the Commission took the freedom to choose consumers between the repair of the goods and its exchange. We can use various incentives, but the choice must remain on the consumer side. Such an incentive will be a solution that provides a consumer decisive for repair during the warranty period to receive an additional 12 -month legal protection for his repaired product. This is a very good solution.","- Mrs. President!

I know that it is a big word inconvenience for some macronists, but those who pay our salary, it is not your distant friends, it is the European workers. They are the ones we have to serve. And we did it by amendment, but unfortunately, for political reasons, you ignore them. ""Brussels does not know how to serve, but Brussels can harm,"" as Molière said. So today, in Brussels or Berlin, you realize very late that you have destroyed entire sections of European industry. We no longer support these frequent lessons and these feigned sweets from the majority Macron/von der Leyen, all these preachers seasoning with virtue. The right to repair must find a fair balance between the purchasing power of consumers and an acceptable cost for the industries. However, this Brussels commission broke our industry with absurd decisions that have exploded the prices of gas and electricity, and scares our jobs. Are our diesel cars repairable or disposable? Is the Fessenheim power station reparable or disposable? Is Nord Stream reparable or disposable? You have broken our automotive industry, you broke our nuclear momentum and closed the Fessenheim power station, while it worked. Germany dismantles its wind turbines that do not work to resume coal. You waste the energy of Europeans and scare away our businesses. What services have you rendered to Europe and France? We are still lagging behind. France has now come down to Greece in terms of industry in GDP. If we install the trains in Bulgaria, which will repair the SNCF? Where is the takeoff of French digital, if not European? After decades of industrial destruction, it is also time, yes, to repair Europe.

165993,"– Madam President, Commissioner, colleagues, digitalisation has been one of the two main priorities announced by President von der Leyen in the beginning of this mandate This regulation is the flagship of European digitalisation. All European citizens will have access to a highly secure digital identity. There will be a legally binding digital signature recognised throughout the European Union. This will simplify the everyday lives of European citizens when dealing with both public administration and the private sector. It will reduce the cost of doing business and lead to significant economic benefits. In my home country, as Mr Ansip said, we have used this digital signature for 22 years and the results are very impressive. We have we save about 2% of the GDP per year due to efficiency in working hours. I am glad that we finally managed to conclude very long negotiations and a deal before the end of this mandate. It is a good deal which ensures the whole system is highly secure and trustworthy. I urge the colleagues to vote in favour of this agreement.","– Madam President, Commissioner, colleagues, digitalisation has been one of the two main priorities announced by President von der Leyen in the beginning of this mandate This regulation is the flagship of European digitalisation.

We have optional data sharing, we have partially open source code. The digital wallet should be used voluntarily. These are certainly important victories, but unfortunately there are risks, because the design, as it is built, would still need to work. There are parts that could be misused to monitor the privacy of our citizens. And this can be a big problem, especially in countries that are with a lawyer on Scorpio, such as Hungary or Slovakia. So, unfortunately, we cannot support the final proposal. I believe that the implementation in the Czech Republic will be fine, because I have full confidence in our Deputy Prime Minister for Digitization, but I would very much wish the rest of Europe to have the opportunity to finish this text.","- Mrs. President, European Digital Identity is certainly an important part of digital Europe brings theoretically the possibility of significant simplification of everyday life for our citizens and businesses, unfortunately, also carries some concerns about privacy and security as a shadow newsletter I tried to solve these problems, especially in terms Mandatory certification and the so -called unique identification number, which could be misused for dangerous monitoring of citizens thanks to our efforts, we managed to achieve certain guarantees.

We support the fundamentals of the compromise text from the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI), as it is important to give a clear message for this direction to all parts of the industry and provide solid ground for all EU companies, especially the SMEs. For the EPP, it was important to table very specific amendments – some jointly with Renew – to ensure that those who have not yet moved to clean alternatives have the time to do so safely, by taking into consideration the safety concerns, energy efficiency and the priority targets. I would like to thank the ENVI rapporteur, Bas Eickhout, and the rest of the shadows for their help during the conciliations. I would also like to thank the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) rapporteur, Sara Skyttedal, for her valuable contribution.

But they have a particularly high greenhouse potential. At the same time, they can be avoided relatively well in almost all fields of application. The EU therefore already took an important step with the F-GAS Ordinance in 2014. And it is now about recharging this report and bringing our claims to the amount of time. I understand that every change leads to uncertainty. But we rely on European know-how, and we want to strengthen research and innovation here. We are primarily concerned with promoting and supporting European companies, so it takes a sense of proportion and planning security. This is certainly guaranteed here with the present report. As a result, we also moved in some safety networks. But what we certainly don't want are expensive and, above all, briefly applicable interim solutions and the stronger use of other chemically toxic substances - we certainly don't want that.","- Mr. President!

162976,"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the protection of the ozone layer is one of the priorities of Renew Europe and, therefore, we really welcome the agreement that is put on the table on the ozone-depleting substances We believe that further restriction of those substances will help close the ozone layer and as such will contribute to the public health. So I believe we will be able to support this proposal successfully tomorrow. Now, concerning the second regulation on fluorinated gases, we have here, as correctly said, ambitious proposals from the Environmental Committee aiming to vastly and fastly reduce the use of fluorinated gases. The direction is good, to my feeling with this report, we would undermine further sustainability elements such as the circular economy, energy or material efficiency. And as well, we could put a risk on meeting the goals of the REPowerEU. This is the reason why some elements have been some amendments, parallel plenary amendments have been tabled in order to address those concerns. I believe that we will be able also to support those amendments. One example for all Renew Europe proposes to bring into the game the spare parts, because we definitely do not want to force the public to buy new devices before the end of the given life of their currently used product. At the end, I would like to thank to both rapporteurs and all the shadow teams and all those working on those two pieces of legislation.

One example for all [GROUP] proposes to bring into the game the spare parts, because we definitely do not want to force the public to buy new devices before the end of the given life of their currently used product. At the end, I would like to thank to both rapporteurs and all the shadow teams and all those working on those two pieces of legislation. They are very interesting, very technical, and I believe we will have tomorrow a successful vote."
162976,"- Mr. President! First of all, a big thank you to my Swedish colleague Jessica Polfjärd It has been a lot of fun to work together it has been ambitious and it has become a good result, but given it, I really wonder, how come the moderates at home in Sweden is not ambitious in the climate issue and climate change? The evaluation made by the Climate Policy Council today in the morning was not just a saw - it was a chainsaw massacre of the current moderately -led government's climate work at home in Sweden. When it comes to the chairmanship of the Council of Ministers, it has been anything but ambitious when it comes to climate change. As soon as the word comes in, you have even acted rather like a brake pad in climate change. But you, Jessica, have done a great job. I hope you can be an inspiration for other moderates at home in Sweden. If nothing else, you may well call home to the prime minister and say that it is time to raise the ambitions even at home. Because it really is needed!","- Mr. President!

162976,"– Mr President, well, if you know, we will vote tomorrow on the revision of the Regulation on fluorinated greenhouse gases, also known as ‘F—gases’, which belongs among the greenhouse gases Therefore, like CO2, they have come under the Commission’s scrutiny It is, of course, right to limit the use of F—gases, because they have a high global warming potential, even greater than CO2 itself. At the same time, it should be done wisely and definitely not by shooting ourselves in our own foot. Besides their other applications, F—gases are used in heat pumps, which become one of the most effective tools to save energy and to cut off from Russian gas. That is why more and more households are installing them and public demand is increasing. I want to thank Bas Eickhout for his rapporteurship, which he carried out in an open—minded and constructive way. I want to thank him, for example, for finding a solution regarding the usage of F—gases for the cooling of nuclear power plants. On the other hand, some crucial elements are still missing in the final compromise. The phase-out of the F—gases in the heat pumps is, in my opinion, too fast for us to be able to meet the requirements. Therefore, I want to recommend that we vote for some amendments.","– Mr President, well, if you know, we will vote tomorrow on the revision of the Regulation on fluorinated greenhouse gases, also known as ‘F—gases’, which belongs among the greenhouse gases Therefore, like CO2, they have come under the Commission’s scrutiny It is, of course, right to limit the use of F—gases, because they have a high global warming potential, even greater than CO2 itself.

162976,"-Mr. President, honorable colleagues, the revision of the F-Gas Regulation touches many sectors and will have a crucial importance for the European and Italian industry once again the Parliament has produced a relationship that, if adopted, will lead to an important contraction of the turnover of Italian companies, compromising jobs in Europe and moving investments outside the EU. This text is negative for the environment, damages the objectives of Repowereu and slows down the decarbonisation and independence from fossil fuels. In some sectors, prohibiting equipment containing greenhouse F-Gas, although low global warming potential, is not quickly achieved today. Few equipment that use F-Gas can use alternative sources, or for lack of technological innovation or because they are potentially dangerous or worse from an environmental point of view. We must reconsider the word ""ecological transition"". We have to take into account the times, scan them better and share them with the industries. We must allow industries to safeguard the environment, workers, families and all the induced affected by this revision. Continuing in this ideological approach used so far, does not help the European economy, but goes to the detriment of businesses, our territories and provides yet another assist to foreign countries. This is a wrong direction, if we want to support the environment and our industry. We will support the amendments that will present the PPE, because the environmental setting is correct and we share it, we are all in favor of the environment, but we must do it by respecting the times that allow us today, through our industries, to be able to maintain the well -being that We have reached.","-Mr. President, honorable colleagues, the revision of the F-Gas Regulation touches many sectors and will have a crucial importance for the European and Italian industry once again the Parliament has produced a relationship that, if adopted, will lead to an important contraction of the turnover of Italian companies, compromising jobs in Europe and moving investments outside the EU.

168448,"– Madam President, dear colleagues, for too long we have been turning a blind eye to the suffering of countless individuals who are forced to toil in deplorable conditions, often for little to no pay The bitter reality is that, by allowing products produced through forced labour available in or exported from the European Union, we are being complicit in this injustice By undermining the efforts of ethical businesses that strive to uphold labour standards and human rights, we are sending the message that exploitation and abuse are acceptable as long as they lead to cheap goods. I believe none of us present in this Chamber agrees with this. What we agree on, though, is that the European Union leads by example, always standing up for the values that we hold dear: freedom, dignity and justice for all. To this effect, with this regulation we are clearly stating that products made with forced labour will not be tolerated in any form, and that those who engage in it will face consequences. In this regard, I personally celebrate the balanced, solid and fair agreement reached: Balanced, because it is developed on a risk-based approach, focusing our efforts on the most severe cases. Solid, as it does not only maintain the possibility for the Commission to carry out field inspections even in and outside of Europe, but includes a stronger and more explicit non-cooperation clause as well. Fair, since it ensures a level playing field for our SMEs that shape the very basis of our economy and who are so often overburdened by new regulations. For all these reasons, with this agreement we are sending a strong signal of solid commitment to the principles and values that characterise and differentiate us in the international sphere, while ensuring our strategic autonomy by strengthening the competitiveness of our SMEs. Human rights are non-negotiable, and we will not fail on our commitment to justice and fairness.","– Madam President, dear colleagues, for too long we have been turning a blind eye to the suffering of countless individuals who are forced to toil in deplorable conditions, often for little to no pay The bitter reality is that, by allowing products produced through forced labour available in or exported from the European Union, we are being complicit in this injustice By undermining the efforts of ethical businesses that strive to uphold labour standards and human rights, we are sending the message that exploitation and abuse are acceptable as long as they lead to cheap goods.

We all know these blue disposable gloves: we all have it during the Corona pandemic, they come from 70% from Malaysia, and three companies use this one-off gloves. Living where we have had the ban on forced labor from the ILO since 1930, added again in the Ilo Convention 105 in 1957, it cannot be that companies make additional profits due to the forced labor. Valdi's Dombrovskis was at a conference that I organized with the ILO to present how much. And there are 236 billion additional profits that are achieved on earth through forced labor - incidentally not only in Asia, but also in Europe. You always have to visualize that. And that's why it is true that we do not differentiate in our legislation - the bad outside and the good inside - but it is horizontal, also for the European Union. Import, marketing and export belong on the trash heap of history. We really need resources: we need the database and we also need people in the commission who can implement this and can carry out the investigations. We will also argue for that. This must not be a paper tiger, that must be a reasonable law that helps people in Europe and beyond.","-Ms. President, Mr Executive Vice President of the Commission, dear colleagues!

That is why it is so important that the Commission will take responsibility in the future and, together with the Member States, will carry out the evidence for forced labor in the supply chains. Unfortunately, one has to say: The EU Commission of Von der Leyen has - as much too often - forgot to present an assessment of the consequences for this law. That means we do not know whether this law is practical. That is why it is so important that we have enforced liberals that the law is checked two years after entry into force whether it applies precisely. Because our global commitment to human rights needs an EU that also works.","- Mrs. President! The EU internal market may no longer be a sales market for forced labor products.

168448,"- Mrs. President! Mr. Commissioner! The race for reducing costs in the global economy leads to situations in which enterprises, wanting to generate more profit, use forced labor at various stages of production consumers in the European Union often have no idea about these practices and, by buying a product, suggest mainly the price First of all, in honest companies and their market position. We have to look for ways to effectively detect cases of using children's work or forms of modern slavery, which women often fall victim to. In the immediate vicinity of the European Union there are countries such as Belarus or Russia, which benefit from the economic benefits from the system of criminal colonies and the work of political prisoners. In the process of obtaining metals of rare lands, which are necessary for the production of electronics or batteries for electric vehicles, children are often used for the hardest work. This is an additional social cost of the European Union climate policy, which we must also remember. Unfair companies that have been proven to consciously use forced labor should be firmly punished and eliminated from the EU market, and information on this subject should be public and available to consumers.","- Mrs. President!

According to the international work organization, there are millions of people in the world, including millions of minors, forced to forced work, and the profits deriving from this exploitation amount to almost 220 billion euros every year and these profits have increased by 37 % in a decade. Schiavitu is widespread all over the world, in Africa and in the Asian area of ​​the Pacific, in the Arab States, where the total of people slaveized compared to the total population is drastically gain. Particular attention due to the millions of products that enter the European market every year deserves China and some of its regions, where minorities of Muslim faith have been victims of serious human rights violations for years. Over 1 million people are detained and forced to forced work. Their forced work contributes to the production of numerous goods for different multinationals, goods sold especially in the western European markets, therefore in our home. And if these situations put the chills, there is worse: the exploitation of children. Millions of children exploited. Millions, while our children and grandchildren go to school to play sports or have fun. Fortunately, it is a phenomenon that is trying to stem, but in some countries certain numbers shout revenge. In Thailand, 32% of the entire workforce consists of minors. In India there are almost 60 million children workers. In Nepal 60% of children carry out jobs that prevent their development. 7 million children work in Brazil. For this reason, I welcomed this provision with confidence, which also provides for guidelines for economic operators and authorities to help end the slavery of modern times.","- Mrs. President, honorable colleagues, Mr. Commissioner, every now and then Europe does not give off only what I have called ""Eurofolie"" many times, but also adopts sensible measures like this, which prohibits the products obtained with forced work in the Union market Forced work is a serious plague of society that affects an important part of the world population.

However, we should be honest: the compromise now present does not exhaust us the duty to fundamentally question an economic system that accepts children and forced labor approvingly for its growth. For the 28 million affected people worldwide, the next positive quarterly report is probably a weak consolation. Because we have not succeeded in compensating for the victims of forced labor in the legal text. It is not durable that those affected from forced labor do not receive reparation. Let us ensure that companies or state actors take on the corresponding legal and direct financial responsibility here! I therefore do not see this law as an end but as a starting point to bring social market economy into harmony with human rights and sustainability. Perhaps at the end of one: We have brought a lot on the way to get closer to the 17 sustainability goals of the UN. Our current legislation directly affects goals 8, 10, 12 and 1. Let's stay tuned!

166038,"– , Commissioner, I’m pleased I left home at 0200 this morning to get here for this debate and previously for the EPP discussion on the same The energy crisis has shown us how vulnerable Europe is to sudden energy price hikes Even after this crisis is over, gas prices will remain significantly higher than before 2022 The new normal will hit the pockets of people in the worst performing buildings up to 10 times harder than in energy efficient buildings I have heard from colleagues that the expansion of the ETS and an upscaling of renewable energy should be enough. But alone these are not enough or technically feasible to reach our 2030 and 2050 climate goals. Only complemented by increased renovations and structural measures in the building sector can we do this. And that is what the EPBD is designed to do. Yet the EPBD should not be a one-size-fits-all approach as buildings do not move across borders. Therefore, it is right that Member States have sufficient degrees of flexibility to ensure cost effectiveness, particularly when it comes to EV infrastructure. Colleagues are right that this will take massive investment, and I have been encouraged to see the interest and the engagement of the financial sector. It is fundamental that we get proper access to finance for people and I think we have achieved this in the EPBD. The real enforcement mechanism will be, of course, the market itself. The EPBD is as much about asset protection as it is about climate change, where investments see tangible and predictable returns. Lastly, the EPBD also holds the significant added value of job creation if implemented: 18 000 long-term secure jobs will be created for every billion invested in energy efficiency, for example. These are very important facts. Finally, I urge you all to vote in favour of this very important file tomorrow.","– , Commissioner, I’m pleased I left home at 0200 this morning to get here for this debate and previously for the [GROUP] discussion on the same The energy crisis has shown us how vulnerable Europe is to sudden energy price hikes Even after this crisis is over, gas prices will remain significantly higher than before 2022 The new normal will hit the pockets of people in the worst performing buildings up to 10 times harder than in energy efficient buildings I have heard from colleagues that the expansion of the ETS and an upscaling of renewable energy should be enough.

166038,"– Madam President, dear Commissioner Simson, dear colleagues, the directive on energy performance of buildings is probably one of the most relatable legislation from the Fit for 55 package to our citizens We all know how the energy bills skyrocketed last year, and we do all understand that if we consume less, we’re going to save more. For countries where the energy and heating bills take the majority of the monthly expenses, any improvement in the building efficiency will lead to more money saved for any other needs. This is why we have to support the EPBD. It paves the way for the reduction of our energy consumption and our bills. It focuses on lifting our households from energy poverty. It also insists on the Member States to ring-fence dedicated funds for renovation, and at the same time it gives flexibility to the Member States to adapt the targets depending on their economic and social situation. It also offers flexibility for derogation when it comes to the labour workers, to the construction sector, but at the same time it keeps the ambitious goals of reaching the climate targets we have set and protecting from energy poverty our citizens. It imposes no penalties on the European citizens and households, and it insists that the vulnerable households should be supported so they bear no cost for renovations. I urge you to support the EPBD tomorrow.","– Madam President, dear Commissioner Simson, dear colleagues, the directive on energy performance of buildings is probably one of the most relatable legislation from the Fit for 55 package to our citizens We all know how the energy bills skyrocketed last year, and we do all understand that if we consume less, we’re going to save more.

166038,"- Ms. President, Ms. Commissioner, dear colleagues! The cheapest energy is that we do not consume was as correct as in today's times, when far too many people had to decide between warm apartments and warm meals, because Russia's war of aggression and the associated energy crisis have multiplied their heating invoices so It is not just our climate goals that require quick action. It is also about reducing our dependence on fossil imports and protecting our citizens from high costs. Yes, this will require investments. For Germany, the loan institution for reconstruction expects EUR 254 billion - this is a lot of money. But can I remind you that EUR 200 billion was made available for the German gas price brake in the past year? Money that does not ensure increasing the value of houses, jobs or better quality of living, but flows to a not inconsiderable part to countries in which nobody would want to live here in the room! Therefore, dear colleagues, we need these requirements for better energy requirements for buildings. I ask you for approval tomorrow when voting.","- Ms. President, Ms. Commissioner, dear colleagues!

In doing so, we would also reduce energy consumption, increase energy safety and reduce greenhouse gases. Unfortunately, this is a missed opportunity. This is a very bad report. He does not look at citizens and Member States as partners, but as children to be forced to do a dogmatic green approach. The obsession with the ultimate goal of zero zero greenhouse gas emissions is visible, and reality is ignored and a whole range of quality intercourse. Buildings are forced, a twisted unsuccessful model of renovation. More paper, administrative load, unnecessarily frequent energy certificates, material certificates on global warming and so on. Basically, instead of being an incentive for better energy efficiency, this report has turned into a beating that drives everything solely to reduce greenhouse gases.","- Dear President, Dear Colleagues, this could have been a great report, which is why, as a rapporteur in the shadow, I invested six months of my work and did over a hundred meetings, we had to use the motive of citizens to install smarter solutions in this energy crisis that would reduce directing And help them have a warm and pleasant home.

To approve this commitment is to ensure the correction of a serious social problem, as vulnerable people living in buildings with worse performance, without the possibility of improving the situation, will have support. This proposal establishes mandatory goals for improving the energy performance of existing and new buildings, defines a financial support for this, includes new provisions for the adaptation of buildings to new mobility models, defines certification procedures and declares national plans to ensure ensuring compliance with the objectives. Tomorrow, this house will decide if you really want to make a difference in the lives of millions of people or continue to put the real estate business ahead of so many lives. But, let me, Madar President, say even more. It is with enormous surprise that I see in this house ID and ECR deputies that they voted against this commitment to the committee and in this house, to criticize and say things like the ones we heard here earlier when, in reality, tomorrow, they will present in plenary Amendments that correspond to the text that has already been approved, exactly in these terms, in the responsible committee.

166038,"– , Commissioner Simson, , scaling up the deployment of renewable energy technologies is a vital part of delivering on our climate goals, but it must go hand in hand with maximising the efficiency of our existing building stock – the last missing piece, as the Commissioner just said In 2022, the same year the energy crisis really began to wreak havoc on our electricity and gas bills, the EU relied on expensive imports for 62.5% of its energy consumption. In Ireland, we spend EUR 1 million every hour on fossil fuel imports. Ending our dependence on external sources for our energy supply is good for the climate, good for Europe’s energy security and critically good for our economy and EU competitiveness, as well as job creation, with the construction sector being the largest generator of jobs per million euros invested. The EPBD will make it easier for people to renovate their homes, ensuring our buildings consume less energy and rely on cheaper and greener renewable sources. For residential buildings it is completely up to each Member State’s government to decide how they will achieve the 16% energy savings across the stock. Member States may decide to use a combination of various measures. As for non-residential buildings, Member States retain a high degree of flexibility when applying exemptions or derogations, such as historical buildings. Importantly, actions from other pieces of legislation will also contribute to the EPBD. After long negotiations, we now have a sensible compromise on the table that appropriately balances increasing the energy performance of buildings on one hand, while ensuring cost effectiveness and affordability on the other. The threat of compulsory renovation that had been hanging over millions of owners and tenants is now off the table. It is vital that the European Parliament passes the EPBD when it votes tomorrow, and I am pleased that my group will be voting in favour. And finally, I would like to thank a great team of co-rapporteurs – it has been a joy to work with them and hopefully our work will bear fruit tomorrow and into the future in ensuring we have energy-efficient buildings across Europe.","– , Commissioner Simson, , scaling up the deployment of renewable energy technologies is a vital part of delivering on our climate goals, but it must go hand in hand with maximising the efficiency of our existing building stock – the last missing piece, as the Commissioner just said In 2022, the same year the energy crisis really began to wreak havoc on our electricity and gas bills, the EU relied on expensive imports for 62.5% of its energy consumption.

We have to say clearly that it is not just a matter of ordinary remediation, which is very common and often practiced in Member States so far. I am glad that we were able to negotiate a text that actually encourages deep repairs, which could actually lead to a reduction in household bills by nearly 50%. We have also made an important compromise that repairs should start with the most vulnerable families to help them get out of energy poverty. We have also been able to include innovative financial mechanisms for easier access to financing preferential conditions. In this way, more households will be able to invest in improving their standard of living without further burdening the family budget. This directive is the first step to eliminating the energy poverty of the continent, so we must support it. The bills will not decrease only if we use cheaper energy sources. We need to consume energy efficiently because this is the future. Thanks to Kiran Kuff and the whole team who has been working on this legislation for two years to guarantee a future in Europe.","-Mr President, in recent years, energy efficiency has become an element of the national security of each of the countries in Europe with all the surrounding crises, our citizens expect us to find the long-term decisions that allow them to pay lower Energy and Heating Accounts Directive for the Energy Characteristics of Buildings, which we will vote tomorrow, in practice institutionalizes plans for renovation of the European Union Building Fund.

This guideline unfortunately does not guarantee that the governments are left, but the directive includes fines, if it doesn't go fast enough, if your apartment is not insulated quickly enough we have already seen what a bad idea is in Flanders. The Flemish government came two years ago with a very strict version of that renovation obligation: fines if you buy a home and the energy label does not improve fast enough. For example, because the works drag on or because you no longer have the money. Then you get monster fines. Absurd ideas. At a certain point a young couple, I believe, was fined 13,000 in Ghent. You don't think that is possible, because those renovation works are dragging because you don't have the money or because it is less likely to provide. And then you get a fine on top. Yes, then of course it does not move forward at all. What we need here is not a renovationplícht, but a renovation that ensures that everyone can not only renovate, but is also helped when renovating, for example, a third -party calendar system. In Germany, 4 million projects were financed in ten years through a government bank. Let's look at that. Let's take that as a model. That's the Europe that we want.

166051,"– Mr President, Commissioner and colleagues, this is a ground-breaking piece of legislation It is among the first global attempts to regulate AI, and AI has the capacity to solve the most pressing issues, including climate change or serious illness And we want to lay the foundations for doing this here in the European Union This law could become the de facto global approach to regulating AI and especially new types of AI like foundation models. We cannot do this entirely on our own, but we should be leaders in ensuring that this technology is developed and used in a responsible ethical manner, while also supporting innovation and economic growth. It is a clear signal of our openness and our willingness to engage with our international partners on AI that we have aligned the definition with that of the OECD. The AI takes a risk-based approach, and if an AI system is high risk, it must meet fairness, transparency and safety requirements. Systems that present an unacceptable risk will be prohibited. And underpinning all of this is an ambitious regime to support innovation in Europe. Our proposals on sandbox will help ensure that they are developed in a safe, responsible manner in areas that offer the most value and ingenuity in the EU. We are among the first to tackle the fast-moving and evolving technology with a concrete legislative proposal on how to address those powerful foundation models to build trust and provide transparency and oversight of these systems. The absolute minimum that we need to offer here is transparency. It must be clear that this content has not been made by human. And we also go one step further and ask developers of these large models to be more transparent and share their information with providers and how these systems were trained and how they were developed. This should address and alter the environmental sustainability of these systems. So this legislation will contribute to building public trust and certainty with AI by establishing a regulatory oversight body and ensuring that we have openness and transparency.","– Mr President, Commissioner and colleagues, this is a ground-breaking piece of legislation It is among the first global attempts to regulate AI, and AI has the capacity to solve the most pressing issues, including climate change or serious illness And we want to lay the foundations for doing this here in the European Union This law could become the de facto global approach to regulating AI and especially new types of AI like foundation models.

166051,"– Mr President, Madam Commissioner, all the colleagues spoke about the benefits I am not going to repeat it I also believe that we are on the verge of adopting legislation that will find this thin balance between the protection of fundamental rights, protecting the rule of law and promoting innovations At the same time, I have to raise some concerns because some colleagues from the EPP, they already tabled some amendments concerning biometric identity that are almost watering down all that we agreed in the IMCO/LIBE committee meeting and negotiating  to a point which make all those bans meaningless. And I’ll give you this story. I remember that story. We all remember this Pentagon project, I believe, that used AI systems to detect and identify humans. And out of eight troops, nobody was detected. All those guys, they use different amusing tricks, some somersaulting for 300m, some hitting cardboard boxes and one even looked like fruit tree – don’t even ask me what that means. The AI could not detect them because it was never trained of data of people doing so, and it does not possess the creative intelligence of a human being. Colleagues from EPP will try to make the case how these systems could be used to catch criminals. But one thing is very clear to me: those who want to hide from AI systems will always find a way to do so, and always the innocent will suffer. So it’s not a question of whether the AI systems have the potential to result in racially biased and discriminatory outcomes. We actually know for sure that this is the case. We see confirmation of this in the data provided of multiple NGOs. We keep seeing it during the LIBE mission to Washington DC, and we have heard it even from the EU High Commissioner for Human Rights. And no, AI is not dangerous only when used by autocratic governments – when a technology is flawed, it’s flawed no matter who uses it for what purposes.","– Mr President, Madam Commissioner, all the colleagues spoke about the benefits I am not going to repeat it I also believe that we are on the verge of adopting legislation that will find this thin balance between the protection of fundamental rights, protecting the rule of law and promoting innovations At the same time, I have to raise some concerns because some colleagues from the [GROUP], they already tabled some amendments concerning biometric identity that are almost watering down all that we agreed in the IMCO/LIBE committee meeting and negotiating  to a point which make all those bans meaningless. And I’ll give you this story. I remember that story. We all remember this Pentagon project, I believe, that used AI systems to detect and identify humans. And out of eight troops, nobody was detected. All those guys, they use different amusing tricks, some somersaulting for 300m, some hitting cardboard boxes and one even looked like fruit tree – don’t even ask me what that means. The AI could not detect them because it was never trained of data of people doing so, and it does not possess the creative intelligence of a human being.

The potential of artificial intelligence is so great, we can hardly imagine that today - for all areas of life, be it education, work or health, which is why it is so important that we want to lay the basis for which one today with the law on artificial intelligence Type of use of artificial intelligence in a liberal democracy because the opportunity and risk are always in the application of facial recognition - super practical to unlock a cell phone, but biometric facial recognition for monitoring in public space, dear colleagues, we know that from China . That has nothing to look for in a European Union. We have to push a clear stop and promote innovation at the same time. For this, for example, we strengthen experimentation in real laboratories. That is why we decided to rely on quality standards for all-purpose AI and generative AI, such as chatt, and not on bans or a high-risk classification. Because we may not follow fantasies of surveillance or over -regulation in the law on artificial intelligence. Our goal must be to strengthen civil rights, to inspire the economy and innovation so that we can make the European Union a hotspot for progress and artificial intelligence.","- Mr. President!

166051,"- Chairman, what do we want the future of our society to look like? Let's determine computers who is right or wrong, who will be a fraudster or criminal, based on where you live, from which sports club you are a member and which profession do your parents have? Or do we assume the good in people and do we give everyone a fair chance? Do we opt for a society where people are constantly followed by supposedly smart cameras, so that governments and companies know exactly where you are and what you do every day? Or do we opt for a society where you can go freely on the street? Due to the rapid rise of artificial intelligence, we have to make fundamental choices about our future. Determine elected representatives that by drawing up solid rules? Or do we put the future of our society in the hands of large tech companies under the guise of innovation? I say: let's send artificial intelligence in the right direction, to technology that helps people and the environment and risks in the use of AI for human rights limit as much as possible. After a year and a half and hundreds of hours at the negotiating table, I am also really proud that the European Parliament now makes choices and tomorrow votes on a strong right to information and explanation, so that people never stand by a computer and know in the use of AI in the use of AI. When an algorithm is used. A mandatory human rights test before we use risky AI. Strict obligations about how you design and train your systems and how you handle data. Because what you put in an AI system is also coming out. This also applies to discriminatory data and disinformation. And that we set limits within the rules instead of self -regulation for large models such as Chatgpt. For the first time worldwide we will report on the environmental impact, and we want to make the environmental standards for systems such as Chatgpt mandatory. We also want a ban on unethical technologies such as emotion recognition, gender or sexuality recognition and face recognition in public space. Europe must choose its own way between surveillance of China and tech capitalism of America. By setting our own conditions for new technologies, we ensure that these technologies in Europe are reliable, ethical, safe and environmentally friendly. Only in this way do we protect our democracy and will we ensure that technology is used in the service of people and the environment instead of the other way around.","- Chairman, what do we want the future of our society to look like?

Thank you to the reporters for their effort put into finding this delicate compromise and my colleagues and experts who supported me during negotiations. Artificial intelligence is already with us, which is why we need these recipes as soon as possible to control and understand it.

Preliminary caution is therefore quite appropriate and in the text, however, is missing. At the same time, it is not possible to talk about good regulation if it allows monitoring employees in the workplace with the help of artificial intelligence without their consent. Is it really our goal to show that this corporate dystopia, where each step of employees will be monitored at workplaces by their superiors and employers, is it okay in Europe? If not, the use of AI needs to be disabled for this purpose. Together with my colleague Ernst, we filed a number of amendments that have citizens' protection in the first place.

166051,"– Mr President, thank you, Commissioner, and thank you to our rapporteurs and all the teams that brought us to this point The final adoption of the Artificial Intelligence Act today is a historic moment. This landmark legislation is a significant step forward in our commitment to responsible digital leadership and creating an ethical future for artificial intelligence in Europe. It provides a robust regulatory framework, promoting trust and transparency in AI systems, establishing clear rules for deployment and for use and development. We are fostering accountability and responsibility across the sectors and along our value chains, and this ensures that AI technologies serve the best interests of our citizens. Crucially, this legislation upholds fundamental rights in the digital age, with strong requirements for fairness, accountability and non-discrimination. We safeguard against unfair biases and injustices that may arise from unchecked AI systems. We can – and we will – unlock the potential of AI in healthcare, climate solutions and for economic productivity, but we also set clear guardrails, a ban on social scoring, discriminatory algorithms and manipulative techniques, and this ensures AI serves humanity and not the other way around. In addition, this act will encourage innovation and competitiveness by providing legal certainty and a level playing field, and we create an environment that is conducive to breakthroughs in AI technology, positioning Europe in this way at the forefront of global innovation. So this is not the last post; the AI Act is the foundation. And now comes the crucial task of implementation and increasing international cooperation. And that is the establishment of the AI area. We welcome that, Commissioner, and we look forward to continuing our engagement with our international partners to ensure that we have a global response to artificial intelligence.","– Mr President, thank you, Commissioner, and thank you to our rapporteurs and all the teams that brought us to this point The final adoption of the Artificial Intelligence Act today is a historic moment.

166051,"– Mr President, Commissioner, 87 % of the respondents to the Eurobarometer Survey on Digital Rights and Principles say that Europeans should be protected against risky or unethical application of digital technologies including artificial intelligence We are answering the demand of the people by introducing this legislation – the first comprehensive set of rules about AI systems We have already said many things about the aspects of this agreement. The co-rapporteurs and the shadows, we all have briefed this room, our groups, our committees many times. This was one of the most publicly documented pieces of EU legislation – the amount of articles and posts on social media was extraordinary, and everyone seems to have a strong opinion of the outcome – and also one of the most lobbied legislation as well. The corporate interests were huge, and I’m proud to say that faced with this enormous pressure, the European Parliament held its ground and fought for its citizens. The EU legislative procedures are too opaque, too confusing, but we are the ones who speak directly, openly to citizens, industry, NGOs. Our meetings are public and well documented. Our positions are clear regardless of which group I’m talking about. It’s the Council who is in debt with its citizens. If there are any shortcomings of this legislation, and there probably are, it’s not because the European Parliament didn’t fight. We secured the ban of certain malicious AI systems. We introduced stricter safeguards on the use of RBI systems. We included foundation models in the scope of the regulation. We fought for more power to individuals when interacting with AI systems. So, thank you to all of you, colleagues, all the usual suspects here, and thank you to your teams. It’s been an incredible journey. And I would like to give the remainder of my time to Svenja.","– Mr President, Commissioner, 87 % of the respondents to the Eurobarometer Survey on Digital Rights and Principles say that Europeans should be protected against risky or unethical application of digital technologies including artificial intelligence We are answering the demand of the people by introducing this legislation – the first comprehensive set of rules about AI systems We have already said many things about the aspects of this agreement.

166051,"- Mr. President! Three and a half years ago we discussed here: What should the European law on artificial intelligence look like? My three demands are still my yardstick today. I asked at the time: We have to promote innovation, strengthen civil rights and harmonize the internal market, let's look in what is now available! The definition of AI is international, real laboratories come and there are clear responsibilities in added value. But there are bureaucracy and ambiguities that will be easier for big-tech companies to be used than for SMEs. I think it becomes important that the commission creates clarity in implementation, because the law on artificial intelligence must not become an innovation brake. In the case of civil rights, we were unable to prohibit biometric real -time monitoring against the Member States, but we were able to collect important undergraduate hurdles. I also fought for stronger rules in the retrograde of biometric identification and the forward -looking police work. I can say we have improved the commission proposal; But I would have liked more joy in innovation and even greater protection of civil rights. But AI progress and regulation will not end with the law on artificial intelligence. For our democratic and economic future, it is important to continue working that governments do not abuse artificial intelligence for surveillance and that innovation has a home in Europe.","- Mr. President!

166051,"– Mr President, colleagues, let’s first state what this is: this vote is a revolutionary step, and from left to right, we bridged our differences – and there were some – and we fought together an unprecedented lobby against rules Today, the EU is taking the lead worldwide with binding rules for artificial intelligence, including for ChatGPT. And with clear rules on how to design and use AI, we’re putting people and society first, and I’m particularly proud that we already managed to learn from mistakes that were made with the use of AI before. We will make sure nobody’s ever classified as a criminal or fraudster purely based on a calculation again. We will make sure people always get an answer to questions they have about certain decisions made by governments, instead of facing a computer that says ‘no’ and leaving people empty-handed. We will make sure a human is always in the loop, so your human rights are protected and you’re not discriminated against. And I’m proud of the clear limits we put to unethical technologies, such as predictive policing, facial recognition in public space, and so-called sexuality recognition. I would have wanted to go even further, with stronger bans closing every loophole, binding environmental standards and mandatory testing for all large language models and image generators instead of only the largest ones. But my fight for this will continue. Let me use my last seconds to once again thank the amazing staff, also from the Commission and the Council, that stayed with us for 38 hours, which was ridiculous and it should not have been that long. But we did it. And thanks for your commitment to staying and keeping us sharp all night long.","– Mr President, colleagues, let’s first state what this is: this vote is a revolutionary step, and from left to right, we bridged our differences – and there were some – and we fought together an unprecedented lobby against rules Today, the EU is taking the lead worldwide with binding rules for artificial intelligence, including for ChatGPT.

164047,"- Mr. President, dear colleagues! The new breeding methods are a huge chance for our farmers You can increase the yield, do without pesticides - in our view, this is also the better way as bans in the area of ​​pesticides, so we are very grateful that Ursula von der Leyen announced this morning Has to withdraw the proposal to Sur and I am also firmly convinced of the new breeding methods - as a doctor and someone who has also dealt with genetics in his doctoral thesis: there are no irresponsible risks. In contrast to conventional genetic engineering, no foreign genes are inserted into these plants. This technique is already used in many parts of the world, and any horror scenarios are not relevant because they have not shown themselves there. The rapporteur Jessica Polfjärd - thank you for that! - has responded to certain concerns; For example, contrary to its original report, the identification of seeds is now included in the proposal of the environmental committee. The environmental committee has accepted this text with a clear majority of 47 to 31, which is why we should also accept it in the plenum tomorrow. Let's give our farmers this opportunity!","- Mr. President, dear colleagues!

Tens of thousands of citizens express themselves and send you - send us - emails to say it, and we should remain deaf and blind to this mobilization? No! The worst in this debate is that we will vote tomorrow. While the scientific foundations of the Commission's proposal are in full scientific controversy, the French agency Anses has published a study which radically calls into question the criteria proposed by the Commission to distinguish categories 1 and 2. This study must be serious Since we will debate it in a committee envi after the vote. It must be serious since Parliament will ask the EFSA a scientific opinion on the opinion of the ANSES, which will have to be rendered in July. You can see the absurdity of this debate to vote while the very terms of the vote are still in full controversy. So yes, this situation is absurd, but yes, we have to give tools to farmers, but yes, we must account for citizens, because they will not want to eat GMOs without choosing it and without knowing it.

164047,"- Mr. President, dear colleagues! There was great hope: the strategy of fewer pesticides, fewer antibiotics, less chemical fertilizers What has become of it? Nothing what do you do now? Liberalize genetic engineering; You can't call it otherwise, it sounds like an auxiliary program for Bayer-Monsanto, what is now being put on the EU is leaving its preventive principle. A principle regulated in the EU leaves this template. There is no check for risk. You just say: there is no risk. Who has ever proven that? There is no traceability and the best thing is: you can't even withdraw permits. And now the usual promises of salvation of genetic engineering come again. Yes, it should fight hunger, it should ensure less pesticides. Look at South America - the old genetic engineering has brought more pesticides, and that will happen with the current one. Now comes the argument climate change. There are only one plant of the 50 things on the table that has to do with it; Everyone else has nothing to do with it. There is the famous GABA tomato that lowers blood pressure. The world was waiting for that, right? We need a clear labeling so that the organic farms continue to have the choice; You don't have that. But Mr. Lins even wants to abolish now that the without a genetic engineering identification is abolished. So you turn the whole thing back again. And a sentence on the subject of patents. It is said that there are no patents now. Of course there will continue to be patents! This is the business model of industry. You have to change the European patent agreement, and there is no question of this at all, here they sprinkle sand in the eye.","- Mr. President, dear colleagues!

164047,"- Mr. President, honorable colleagues, tomorrow is an important day for European agriculture and an important step towards sustainable agriculture I know that in the European Parliament there are many opponents to precision production methods and that these are deliberately confused with GMOs . But GMOs are basically different from new genomic techniques, also because boys were already in Europe and we don't know. They are more efficient, more precise methods and are essential to improve drought tolerances. They are less susceptible to mold and other parasites and can better use nutrients. This is fundamental in an atmosphere in which we have more droughts, more problems and a large push towards the decrease in phytopharmacies and pesticides. So, from this point of view, we must go in this direction, because farmers will be pushed towards better production and, above all, a better surrender of our territories. Therefore, I invite you to vote in favor of the NGT.","- Mr. President, honorable colleagues, tomorrow is an important day for European agriculture and an important step towards sustainable agriculture I know that in the European Parliament there are many opponents to precision production methods and that these are deliberately confused with GMOs .

How is it possible that the future of the entire biological sector is at stake here? That is possible because the biotech industry has done everything to abolish the rules for GENTECH. To top it all off, large seed companies get plenty of room for patenting plants, properties and techniques that are involved in the production of our food. Gentech is not the answer to the major problems that our food system is now suffering from. It does not lead to food security. Germenech reinforces the dependence on fertilizer, agricultural poison and multinationals. It leads to scaling up, monocultures and the fall of small -scale farmers.

164047,"- Chairman, Dear European Commission, Dear members, over time, many of the natural plant properties, defense mechanisms of the plant, from our food crops are crossed defense mechanisms against diseases, pests or even drower resistance through classical breeding, we would again have these defense mechanisms Being able to get back in our plant breeds and grains, for example. Unfortunately this takes decades. And then the question is how long these defense mechanisms can withstand the whims of the outside world. With new breeding techniques we can achieve this within a few years. This way we can better protect our food crops in a natural way. That means less use of crop protection products, but also a lower risk of harvests in, for example, dry and warm areas. Certainly now that climate change is becoming increasingly tangible, this is an absolute must. I have been working on the application of these techniques in the EU for ten years. Meanwhile, breeders are moving abroad, where the legislation has gone with the times. We do not have the luxury to leave these innovations based on a gut feeling unused. I am therefore happy with the new proposal from the European Commission, because this is an important puzzle piece to more sustainable agriculture.","- Chairman, Dear European Commission, Dear members, over time, many of the natural plant properties, defense mechanisms of the plant, from our food crops are crossed defense mechanisms against diseases, pests or even drower resistance through classical breeding, we would again have these defense mechanisms Being able to get back in our plant breeds and grains, for example.

Do we trust them to ensure that it won’t be used to criminalise legitimate political speech and action? I have to say, I don’t This has all the hallmarks of another clumsy and counterproductive neoliberal response to a social problem. It is cheaper to criminalise hate speech than to fund and focus on the strategies that might foster tolerance. It is a gimmick to allow politicians to pretend to care about minorities and racism and so on, while doing nothing to protect them, doing nothing to address the structural issues that lead to hate and intolerance in the first place, structural issues which include centrist politicians dog-whistling about migration. So for me, I think once again, I don’t trust von der Leyen’s Commission to police my speech.","– Madam President, in the past few months, we’ve seen Palestinian solidarity decried as hate speech We’ve seen claims of anti-Semitism being used to downplay the slaughter of innocents in Gaza and to cover up for the legitimate criticism of Zionism And with all of this rage in the background, the EU decides to stomp onto the scene with plans to criminalise hate speech The problem with that is: do we trust the EU to define hate speech?

166172,"- Dear Mrs. President, dear commissioner, values ​​colleagues! Energy security, digitization, fragile business perspectives - the coming years will not be easier for our economy at the forefront of the urgently needed reduction of over -regulation and the return to the principles of the social market economy - by the way, exactly what the internal market is successful for 30 years Immediately afterwards - and the commissioner spoke about it, the colleague Moreno Sánchez spoke to it - but already follows the shortage of skilled workers, who has become increasingly clearer of economic development; It will be much more faithed in the next few years. Every fifth within the European Union is already over 65, the proportion of employees in the population will continue to decrease. Europe needs an answer to this, and the present agreement is another mosaic stone for it. Three things in the negotiations were important to us. The starting point lies in the legal, certified residence and work status. The Member State decides on the type and scope of immigration. The labor market and the labor market examination provide the criteria and the need. With the new version, we therefore focus on more efficient and streamlined procedures for the granting of this combined permission, on ambitious deadlines, but at the same time grant flexibility to the Member States if they are justified, on a number of common rights and duties for the third -state members, which Above all, the areas of working and living conditions will improve, the possibility and the condition for a change of employer after examination by the Member State and the possibility of remaining in the Member State in terms of time in the event of loss of workplace and change, provided that the livelihood are secured independently can. We thus establish a new balance between the interests of companies, the applicant and the Member States. And with a view to the still ongoing or upcoming negotiations, further instruments will be available. Supply and demand can be brought into harmony even better via the talent pool. Cooperation with third countries must be coordinated through the talent partnerships. If we want to maintain our prosperity, our innovative strength, we have to face the competition in particular with the United States, Canada and Australia, because they are still in advertising for the smartest and most talented minds in front of us. With the agreement in front of us, however, we clearly conclude to you. And that's why I would like to conclude with thanks to the rapporteur, to the entire team, to the technical level that is behind it and worked for us to reach this agreement.","- Dear Mrs. President, dear commissioner, values ​​colleagues!

166172,"- Mrs. President, Ms. Commissioner! Do good and talk about it: I think it is good that we hear from various factions that we have really done it to get a combined permission on the way, because wherever I go in my hometown, people And the companies complain about a shortage of skilled workers. We have to train and further train, but we know that alone is not enough. We need the employees from third countries, but we also have to create a good, safe environment for this. It is therefore a good thing that we really resolve the dependence on an employer in regulation because they are better protected against exploitation and arbitrariness. But that's not enough. We also have to ensure that we create good regulations for all employees for the acceptance of migration, from employees from third countries. Therefore, combined permission is really a building block for a European migration and integration policy that protects the rights of all employees.","- Mrs. President, Ms. Commissioner!

We have to get away from irregular migration and come to regular migration for this - the commissioner has already said - the new pact for asylum and migration is important; It is important that we lower irregular migration, but at the same time we need a framework in the European Union, which also enables regular migration to our job market. With the dossier to standardize the legal framework for the residence permit for work, which we discuss today and which we vote this week, we take an important step in this regard, because in fact our companies are desperately looking for qualified workers, and enable with this law We that these workers can be recruited abroad more easily. It is about getting a faster and more uniform procedure in the European Union on the way that deals more flexibly with the rules, which, for example, enables a change of sector that enables an application not only from outside the EU, but can also take place within the EU. I think we are making an important step forward that recruiting workers is easier for companies in the European Union. Therefore I ask you all for approval to this law.","- Ms. President, Ms. Commissioner, revered colleagues, especially dear rapporteurs!

166172,"– Madam President, Commissioner, the Single Permit Directive is mutually beneficial, both for migrants who seek safe and legal pathways into the EU and for the EU wishing to attract skills and talent to its workforce But in order for this law to be truly a win-win situation, we must ensure that migrants don’t end up as the losers Too often, they are trapped in horrible situations of dependency and exploitation by shady employers We now break this chokehold of abusive employers, and we empower the workers to enable them to change course Single permit holders will have stronger rights, including a new right to change employer. They will be entitled to legal stay during unemployment and with three months extra for victims of violations or exploitation. I would prefer to have more improvements, I must admit that, but I’m glad with our achievement, this recast proves that with the right political will, the EU is capable of adopting progressive and human-rights-centred laws on migration. And that’s also thanks to both of the rapporteurs and their staff and secretariat, and to the Commission.

They have brought hundreds of thousands, millions of illegal migrants who carry their culture, which carry their behavior, their civilization, which is different from ours, and are trying to change us. You say that we need to fix the demographic picture and this will not happen with people outside our continent. Or at least this is our vision and it contradicts yours.

Legal immigration therefore adds and not to replace the irregular one, while the demographic crisis is raged throughout Europe and in particular that of the South, a crisis that, according to the left, would affect the work market of the European Union. Mind you that the double demographic crisis and work is the consequence of your political agenda: it would be enough to protect our workers or allow member states to do so, rather than, in the name of austerity, destroy our work policies. The vote directive does nothing but introduce unsustainable bureaucratic burdens for the national authorities of the Member States that manage the migratory phenomenon, such as Italy. So let's say no to a rigid text, excessively guaranteed and controversial, which would create further regulatory fragmentation in the name of an alleged harmonization. Legal migration can only have space after the irregular one has been managed and contained, but the majority of this parliament and the European Commission continue on their way.

For the first time, what is extreme within the European Union is addressed. Spanish citizens cannot rely on the rule of law. If your government pardoned more than 1,000 convicts for the purchase of the votes for the formation of this government, some of which have made it so bad to be afraid of terrorist activities that Spanish citizens have frightened and horror, then this is in the European Union is not acceptable and should be addressed accordingly.","- Mr. President, Dear Commissioner, dear colleagues!

164555,"– Mr  President, populism, disinformation, lack of transparency, and the weakening of institutions and procedures are putting the rule of law and democracy under threat in the European Union And I urge this House to keep on defending democracy, keep on defending human rights and keep on defending the rule of law as a key priority in the next mandate after June, because European citizens depend on their representatives, both at national level and European level, especially when those in power think that popularity absolves them from respecting the rule of law, defending democracy or from protecting human rights. Because in a democracy, popularity should never make anyone believe that they are above the law, or that they could decide which fundamental rights citizens could enjoy. I thank the Commission for once again taking this positive step to look at the situation in each and every Member State. However, I would like to see this procedure happening in a more independent way, rather than relying on Member States having an independent panel which evaluates each and every Member State. And I also would like to see the Commission, as a guarantor of the treaties, to have concrete and speedy actions, to enforce the rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights. Because what we have seen happening with Hungary, for instance, and the conditionality mechanism, is shameful on the Commission. We can never stress enough that democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights are the foundations on which everything else is based on. It is in this light that I cannot but show my disappointment at how our President herself failed to take this message and the resolution adopted by this House to Greece, and pretend that there are no issues, where – I remind – government was tapping politicians and journalists, there are systematic flaws in the rule of law in Greece, and where a journalist has been assassinated and until today, there is total impunity. To conclude, I would like to encourage citizens and civil societies, all European universities and students, human rights defenders to engage in critical thinking, to lead strong democratic revolutions. Some want critical thinking to be seen as a crime. Some political forces are trying to control the media, leading to a situation where pluralism or independent reporting becomes less and less possible. Do not allow this to happen. Do not allow everyone to shut your mouth.","– Mr  President, populism, disinformation, lack of transparency, and the weakening of institutions and procedures are putting the rule of law and democracy under threat in the European Union And I urge this House to keep on defending democracy, keep on defending human rights and keep on defending the rule of law as a key priority in the next mandate after June, because European citizens depend on their representatives, both at national level and European level, especially when those in power think that popularity absolves them from respecting the rule of law, defending democracy or from protecting human rights.

The investiture has occurred in exchange for a promise of impunity to criminals, judged or charged with serious crimes. The Sánchez Government has eliminated the crime of sedition, has reduced the penalties for embezzlement, has pardoned criminals to reiterate their intention to commit crimes and now intends to amnesty fugitives from justice, investigated for terrorism, embezzlement and high treason and investigated in the Files on Russian interference in Europe. And the last, ladies, is a billionaire corruption scandal that the European Office for the Fight against Fraud will investigate and that reaches at least the number two of the Government and the Socialist Party when the events occurred.

164555,"- Mr. Chairman! Mr. Commissioner! We have another report on breaking the rule of law and you made amendments to it about positive changes in Poland and I would like you to all hear now, what positive changes are introduced in Poland, because in the future you may be concerned with all public media authorities in Poland have a legally provided term of office . Tusk, however, did not want to wait and forcibly took public media without any legal basis and threw out almost all employees, including a pregnant and disabled woman. And the buildings ordered to surround the police. His minister used the forged notarial acts for the whole action, and the prosecutor who detected this was degraded. In the meantime, the unlawfulness of Tusk's actions was confirmed by the courts and the Constitutional Tribunal. Tusk and his people did not follow any judgment, and his minister's decision was considered - I quote - ""non -existent"", because - I also quote - ""does not meet the criteria of importance."" So real lawyers and those people who shouted about the independence of the courts must have a good rip when they hear that the minister's message about the importance is higher than the Act and the Constitution. In addition, Minister of Justice Bodnar throws almost one judge from some function every day. And the question is, did you really want such independence? In addition, Tusk's people took a national prosecutor a moment later. They cannot dismiss him without the president's consent, so they took his office by force. And they turned off the cards to him and his deputies and do not let in the buildings. And you are probably wondering why he does all this for? A moment later it turned out. His people turned the case of the Senate Marshal from Tusk, towards whom 250 people testified that he had demanded a bribe from them. 250 people. Do you know a similar case in the history of the European Union? And you think that these changes are good and lawful. Politics can be perverse. I want to tell you all. And make sure that one day someone would not do it to you here in the European Parliament. The buildings took strength. Turned off the cards.

But I want the world to hear about your hypocrisy.","- Mr. Chairman! Mr. Commissioner! We have another report on breaking the rule of law and you made amendments to it about positive changes in Poland and I would like you to all hear now, what positive changes are introduced in Poland, because in the future you may be concerned with all public media authorities in Poland have a legally provided term of office . Tusk, however, did not want to wait and forcibly took public media without any legal basis and threw out almost all employees, including a pregnant and disabled woman. And the buildings ordered to surround the police. His minister used the forged notarial acts for the whole action, and the prosecutor who detected this was degraded. In the meantime, the unlawfulness of Tusk's actions was confirmed by the courts and the Constitutional Tribunal. Tusk and his people did not follow any judgment, and his minister's decision was considered - I quote - ""non -existent"", because - I also quote - ""does not meet the criteria of importance."" So real lawyers and those people who shouted about the independence of the courts must have a good rip when they hear that the minister's message about the importance is higher than the Act and the Constitution. In addition, Minister of Justice Bodnar throws almost one judge from some function every day. And the question is, did you really want such independence? In addition, Tusk's people took a national prosecutor a moment later. They cannot dismiss him without the president's consent, so they took his office by force. And they turned off the cards to him and his deputies and do not let in the buildings. And you are probably wondering why he does all this for? A moment later it turned out. His people turned the case of the Senate Marshal from Tusk, towards whom 250 people testified that he had demanded a bribe from them. 250 people. Do you know a similar case in the history of the European Union? And you think that these changes are good and lawful. Politics can be perverse. I want to tell you all. And make sure that one day someone would not do it to you here in the European Parliament. The buildings took strength. Turned off the cards.

164555,"- Mr. President, in the report on the rule of law within the European Union, the Commission and the rapporteur compete to distribute good and bad points around them and shoot red bullets on all those who dare Distring the federalist diktat of Brussels but the same ones who compete to point the shortcomings of others make the deaf ear when it comes to pointing their own. On the 43 pages in the report, only a few lines evoke the lips the occurrence of the very worrying and the great scandal and very important scandal of Qatargate. This scandal which shaken the European Parliament on December 9, 2022 and which has since experienced many twists and turns. The designated corrupter, Qatar, the alleged corrupt, the European deputies, to begin, remember, by Eva Kaïlí, then socialist vice-president of parliament. But who can today certify to us that the extent of the influence and corruption of our institutions by Qatar is limited to the bags filled with cash found in Mrs. Kaïlí? More than a year later, many questions remain unanswered. Worse, other questions have been added to it. But why does the OLAF, does the European Union control body not react? Is there a link, even indirect, between Qatar and subsidies to associations close to the Muslim Brotherhood, like Femysto? Could there be a link between Qatar and the European Union immigrationist policies which help to aggravate Islamist communitarianism on our continent? And why finally, the majority of deputies of this European Parliament refused an internal commission of inquiry? It is more than time to shed light on the influence of Qatar and their relays here, within the European Union and can be even beyond. There is an emergency. Yesterday, the Emir of Qatar was received by Emmanuel Macron at the Élysée and we continue here to close our eyes.","- Mr. President, in the report on the rule of law within the European Union, the Commission and the rapporteur compete to distribute good and bad points around them and shoot red bullets on all those who dare Distring the federalist diktat of Brussels but the same ones who compete to point the shortcomings of others make the deaf ear when it comes to pointing their own.

Because we must worry about respecting the rule of law within certain Member States. And it is however this democratic framework which allows the guarantee of our fundamental freedoms and no state, even less member of the Union, should be able to attack it with impunity. Thus, we must preserve press freedom, public freedoms, as we have recalled in our fight against the use of spy software such as Pegasus. In fact, too many governments play with our fundamental rights, as if they were only adjustment variables. This parliament has also already established many shortcomings within the Member States and the last minute amendments deposited by certain groups will not be able to change the reality of things. So tomorrow, let us make this report adopted for what it contains, for what it represents. But I also think for the hope that he will bring to better tomorrows for our democratic life.","- Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, Dear colleagues, I would like to salute the importance of this report and the observations that he poses the rule of law is fundamental to advance the democracy which is today attacked, weakened and why ?

And, for that, we have introduced guarantees to do so with maximum security, privacy and trust. The citizen will have control of their data and may restrict or decide who can access them and for what. It is an interoperable health data space that will allow better diagnoses and reduce tests and duplicities of tests. But, in addition, the potential is enormous if these data - in a safe, anonymity and with the patient's consent - are made available to medical research. It will mean a giant step to accelerate the development of new medications and clinical trials, and a critical mass of data at European level is vital for the investigation of rare diseases and to save human lives.

The European area for health data can make a real difference for patients in the EU - a digital space that enables my doctor in Luxembourg to use the data that a doctor in France saved during my last treatment Of course, my dentist does not necessarily need to know that I was also treated with a psychologist in this digital space, I can decide for whom I open which door and to whom I show which door at all. This also applies to my anonymized health data, which, for example, A pool of anonymized data from all over Europe can be used in research - this can be a real gamuchanger for research, for future treatments, but also for prevention in health crises. The data space brings a particularly great advantage to the people who have a rare illness - 30 million people in the EU. 95 percent of them support this creation. Because this data space creates hope: a way to get access to specialized medical care in other European countries, to get a diagnosis earlier and to learn more about its little -known illness through research. And access to my own data, simply from home. Data protection is of course the be -all and end -all of this space, because health data are sensitive information that may only be in the hands of those for which they are also intended.

When I read the original project of the European Commission over a year ago, I doubted whether this very comprehensive and innovative project has a chance of success and whether it interferes too much in our privacy or national health care systems, however A text that significantly improves the text of the commission. Thank you to the reporters for good cooperation. I especially appreciate the extension of patient control over data storage and sharing. Our text also strengthens the supervision and monitoring system for the security of collecting, storing and sharing data at the level of national supervisory authorities. Thus, we managed to seal the provisions of many articles of the Regulation in accordance with the principle that I often pointed out: firstly, data processing security. I am also happy with a reasonable narrowing of the secondary scope of data use. The so-called opt-out option should help build citizens' trust in the system. In the course of upcoming three -sided negotiations, I will support solutions maximally increasing the security of processing this data and minimizing the goals of this processing. Thank you again for good cooperation to all counter -advisers, primarily rapporters, and I hope that we have a good basis for negotiating with the Council and the project tomorrow will get the support of the majority.","- Mrs. President!

166177,"- Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner Breton, honorable colleagues, finally law on Ciberresilienza arrives in the plenary for 2030, more than 120 billion related objects are expected, a rapid figure over time of the internet of things and artificial intelligence. These objects help us in daily life: I think of home automation, smart appliances, medical devices connected on the net and, when they are integrated with production processes, allow you to make leaps forward in innovation and competitiveness. Precision agriculture is an example. The intelligent objects are useful but vulnerable and must be defended by the increasingly frequent IT attacks, such as the undue appropriation of data, the online fraud, the boycott of critical infrastructures, as we have often seen in the hospital and health. This in a geopolitical scenario where IT attacks are increasingly hybrid war tool. Without forgetting the economic damage, especially for small and medium -sized enterprises: in Europe almost two out of three companies declare that in the event of a computer attack they would risk bankruptcy. A specificity, this, which I wanted to be recognized by this law, with the provision of support measures starting from training programs, support for the tests of products and simplified procedures for the evaluation of their conformity. It is therefore important to systematically identify vulnerability and threats and protect citizens and businesses. This new European law, of which I am a speaker for the group of socialists and democrats, allows us to do so by exploiting the size of the single market to give more timely and coordinated answers. In fact, the weaker ring safety is in fact the security of everyone. We have established common rules for the digital products for the first time, whether imported, where encrypted has been important since the design. The new rules provide for the obligation for manufacturers to provide updates and information and, moreover, to report the competent authorities and applied solutions to the competent authorities. But making laws is not enough if the awareness of each of us does not increase. The safety of the objects connected on the net starts from us and from the development of the skills necessary at all levels. Here we have to accelerate because the current one, of almost one million jobs, must be filled and represents a great opportunity especially for our young people. Then strength with the training, which we wanted to write clearly in the regulation, and now we must ensure that this goal translates into adequate projects and funds.

There’s plenty of concerns – all European intelligence agencies have these concerns about Chinese hard- and software, for example, being leveraged in their offensive espionage program – leveraged against us. So we need legislation, and this week we vote on the cybersecurity legislation of hard- and software products in a very good law.

166177,"- Dear president, dear commissioner, dear colleagues, we have greatly debated cybersecurity, technologies, processes and measures to prevent cybercrime. We don't talk so much about what happens when these barriers are insufficient - the huge loss of time and money caused by these attacks. In Portugal, cybership increased 23 %, starting to seriously compromise the security of business systems and data and other societies. CIBER - Resilience precisely means the ability to maintain operating systems, with a minimum of impact on efficiency, when the unexpected happens - not only cybership, but also other unforeseen events, such as natural disasters. The text we prepare to approve seeks to establish this complementarity between cybersecurity and cyber - resilience. The proposal offers a proper balance between the proposed objectives and the concern to avoid an administrative overload, namely for SMEs and commercial use software. The application of the law, within three years, gives companies the time to prepare.","- Dear president, dear commissioner, dear colleagues, we have greatly debated cybersecurity, technologies, processes and measures to prevent cybercrime. We don't talk so much about what happens when these barriers are insufficient - the huge loss of time and money caused by these attacks. In Portugal, cybership increased 23 %, starting to seriously compromise the security of business systems and data and other societies. CIBER - Resilience precisely means the ability to maintain operating systems, with a minimum of impact on efficiency, when the unexpected happens - not only cybership, but also other unforeseen events, such as natural disasters.

All these objects can be hacked: your privacy can be revealed, money can be extorted to you ... This is where this European law comes in, which will protect you, you, your families, but also our companies, which use Always more connected objects.

168434,"- Mr. President, in today's debate on the economic governance in the last plenary of this legislature, we emphasize again on the importance of fiscal policies, monetary strategies and financial regulations meant to ensure stability and growth in the euro area but I am glad that these discussions also involves Budget discipline, structural reforms and measures to approach economic disappearances between Member States. We must strengthen the internal market, the capital, to emphasize competitiveness, we need an industrial pact, and I also say it as president of the ITRE Commission, and on the strengthening of our economic actors of all dimensions and yes, from all regions of the Union. We need clear rules, clear implementation and a reasonable balance between reducing excessive debt and allowing investments. This was the compass of the PPE group when contouring the new fiscal rules for the Member States of the European Union and this must continue to be the compass of the new Parliament. Solid finances and sustainable levels of debt remain essential, especially given the recent increase in the cost of public loans. The new framework is a solid basis for the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union and I believe that these rules will make the future more predictable. Solid financing remains a priority and, here, the involvement of institutions such as the European Central Bank and the European Commission is necessary and important, to reduce the burden for the Member States and to really strengthen fiscal policy.","- Mr. President, in today's debate on the economic governance in the last plenary of this legislature, we emphasize again on the importance of fiscal policies, monetary strategies and financial regulations meant to ensure stability and growth in the euro area but I am glad that these discussions also involves Budget discipline, structural reforms and measures to approach economic disappearances between Member States.

But it is also true that we cannot continue without norms; We need to have rules that guide tax policies. I am glad - first - of the broad consensus to reject the previous norms that forced an austericide after the financial crisis of a little more than a decade, and that the consensus to reject those rules allowed to illuminate a new agreement towards a Soft reduction in debt according to the situation of each state. I trust that this is and that this Parliament will closely supervise the application of these norms in the next legislature.","- Mr. President, Commission, it is a pleasure to conclude this mandate with this vote and with this debate because in this legislature we have lived - as both commissioners remembered - complicated moments: the pandemic or the beginning of the Putin war in Ukraine both challenges demanded flexibility from the fiscal point of view and that we took time to allow an answer that maintained the activity in those difficult times.

168434,"- Chairman, Commissioner, colleagues, budget rules aim to pursue healthy public finances in the interest of our society and our economy. They must ensure that future generations are not saddled with the consequences of excessive debt accrual, and this is often forgotten today - A monetary Union simply cannot survive without budgetary discipline The new budget rules that are currently ongoing offer flexibility, so that important investments, in infrastructure and defense, can continue for example. At the same time, they also impose discipline, but that will only happen if the committee is willing to also remove the stick if necessary. I fear that that will not happen sufficiently. One must be able to intervene in a credible and effective way if the budget of a Member State derails, as is very clear today in my home base Belgium. Opting for more debt building at European level is an irresponsible flight ahead. Now that more and more Member States are at the end of their Latin in terms of budget and debt, they are going to bring the claim economy into a new and dangerous phase. That is irresponsible. If countries have insufficient budget capacity, the answer is not the building of debt at the European level, but a well -considered remediation, linked to growth -imulating reforms. Take Ireland: twelve years ago 120% debt Bbp, now 40%. How? By more or less balancing the budget, reforming and stimulating growth. It is that simple.","- Chairman, Commissioner, colleagues, budget rules aim to pursue healthy public finances in the interest of our society and our economy.

163628,"– Madam President, Commission Presidency, I will start with a quote from a former Belgian Prime Minister and founding father of the EPP Wilfried Martens once said: ‘There will be only an ambitious Europe or no Europe at all’ And at the beginning of this electoral year, we proved this. Ursula von der Leyen has demonstrated together with us in the last years that we are ambitious on climate policy, the Brexit agreement, COVID vaccines, RRF, Ukraine support and the migration policy. The EPP is not building castles in the air like some of the left are doing, and we are not having a wrecking ball in our hand like the radical right is doing. The EPP’s Europe is an ambitious Europe and we deliver. I want to thank for this. The European Council in December showed leadership: yes to Ukraine, yes to Ursula von der Leyen’s proposal on enlargement to start the negotiations, especially with Ukraine. This was an historic decision and gives certainty to the Ukrainian people. Yes, you can be part of our family. Yes, it’s worth to fight against Putin. Yes, Ukraine must win the war. But the European Council also failed when it was about the money – to create certainty on our long-term financing of the European Union. And yes, there is a question now with Viktor Orbán and Hungary on the table. For us, as the European Parliament, it was a huge success in this mandate to establish a binding rule of law mechanism. It was our common effort, our common success. For us, as the EPP, it was always important to have a fact-based assessment about rule of law in individual cases. And for us now, the important thing is that we need further clarification. As the EPP, we initiated a letter to ask in the BUDG Committee and also in the CONT Committee about the reasoning behind the decision of the Commission. And we are welcoming Commissioners Schmit, Reynders and Commissioner Hahn to inform us about this. That’s the next step in front of us. Hungary has for a long time here in this Parliament been seen as a difficult case. We have initiated an Article 7 case against Hungary. And if I may say so, it’s great to hear the Council telling us that the Commission decision must be assessed. But the most important thing – what I would love to see from the Council side – is to answer our request on Article 7, because that is on the table and until now the leaders had no courage, and obviously no time even, to discuss the Hungarian case on substance on the Council side. So please answer the demand from Parliament. The question now on the table for Ukraine is how to pay teachers, how to pay nurses, doctors and all of the soldiers? How to convince our American friends and the IMF to continue supporting Ukraine? Having this in mind, the end of January Council must deliver. We must be prepared for all options at the end of this month and we, as the EPP, also insist on the other elements on the MFF: don’t forget about migration, for example. At the beginning of 2024, I want also to speak about the broader perspective. An ambitious approach is needed – I said it. What do we have to do? First of all, we have to come back to a very old idea in Europe. Belgium had already ratified the European Defence Union before it was stopped by the French National Assembly in 1953, nine years after the end of the Second World War. Another former Belgian Prime Minister and former NATO Secretary General, Paul-Henri Spaak, said rightly afterwards: ‘There are only two types of states in Europe: small states and states that have not yet realised that they are small’. Europe must stand united against Putin. Now it’s the right moment to build up a European defence pillar. We cannot have 180 different weapon systems while the US only has 30. Imagine how much we could increase our defence capabilities only with the introduction of a single market for defence systems. Let’s build up our own defence capabilities in the next years, for example, with a European missile defence shield, a cyber-brigade or even a nuclear shield. With ambitious investments in European defence, we can keep the biggest promise of Europe, and that is a promise of peace. Alongside defence, migration is a second important pillar for our family. We have to finally complete now this legislation. Le Pen, AfD and Orbán are trying to torpedo the European solution because they want to use the substance of this problem for their egoistic political benefit. They don’t want to solve the problem. They are the problem. And that’s why we must finalise this legislation. And my appeal today goes especially to the Greens. I understand that they are not yet decided whether they can support the final outcome of this migration deal. Imagine for a second the Migration Act failing in this House. Imagine for a second. That would mean that we help Le Pen, AfD and FPÖ, that we would fuel extremists all over Europe. And that’s why it’s now the moment to take over responsibility and finalise this migration deal And the last point I want to mention is economic issues for us as the EPP. This will be the driving issue for this election campaign – to have jobs, to have good incomes, to have prosperity, to have a strong economy. Germany is already in recession and we need not another European traffic light coalition. What we need is economic strength for Europe and that is what the EPP will be asking for.","– Madam President, Commission Presidency, I will start with a quote from a former Belgian Prime Minister and founding father of the [GROUP] Wilfried Martens once said: ‘There will be only an ambitious Europe or no Europe at all’ And at the beginning of this electoral year, we proved this.

163628,"– Madam President, Council, dear President von der Leyen, colleagues, I want to start by saying that whoever leads the Council on its special meeting on the 1st of February needs to show enough strength and leadership to overcome the blackmail of Orbán and deliver on the EU budget and the support to Ukraine Europe is yet again at an existential moment. Europeans are looking at us. European leaders need to show that they can actually be respected by our citizens and the whole world. Who could tell that through this mandate, our geopolitical Europe would indeed be tested so much? Yes, we delivered in the vaccines altogether, but too many of them were sold to the developed world while the rest of the world was looking at us in agony. Yes, we delivered with resolve to the Ukrainians for these two years, including by opening the negotiations for accession just a month ago. But when the US are starting to falter, we are not yet filling the gap, even if it is our security, our values and our freedom that is being fought for on those fields. We are taking too long to create our own strategic autonomy in a world that is much more confrontational now. We are giving in to the blackmail of Orbán, and all the bullies in Europe are rejoicing with that. The Europeans are suffering and the populists, they are laughing at it because they will grow from anger and frustration, turning suffering and fear into hatred. And now, at this critical moment, we are faced with a proposal to eventually start cutting our policies that can help those that are suffering to pay for the interests of Next Generation EU. We cannot do more, like helping Ukrainians or all the correct priorities you identified, Madam President, with less, at the cost of other policies like cohesion policy. Europeans want fair transitions and better housing for all. They want to reinforce our social economic model, not to see it endangered by austerity policies imposed by the Council. We will fight as a parliament for social convergence and sustainable investment in the new fiscal rules. The populists, the neo-fascists, the anti-Europeans that now you worry about, Mr Weber, those are coming now out of every corner. They are raising their arms into the open air, fuelling from people’s frustrations. The Europeans are asking us, where is Brussels when we need it? This is a defining moment.

The populists, the neo-fascists, the anti-Europeans that now you worry about, Mr Weber, those are coming now out of every corner. They are raising their arms into the open air, fuelling from people’s frustrations. The Europeans are asking us, where is Brussels when we need it? This is a defining moment. Europe needs to find strength and the will to fight hatred yet again."
163628,"– Madam President, I ask of Ms von der Leyen, can I ask you a very simple question? That is, are you going to repeat the practice that happened during the previous European Council in December? You remember that? The blackmail by Viktor Orbán to use the veto And then just before that European Council, the freezing of I think it was 11 billion, in exchange for the fact that he left the room That was the deal: ‘11 billion and you leave the room’ So my question to you is, are you going to do that again? Because it could happen on 1 February That is, that he again uses his veto, now for another thing, not for the accession negotiations, but for liberating the 50 billion of funds that are desperately needed for Ukraine  And I have to tell you very openly, before you answer, that if your answer is a yes, then you will run, I think, into big troubles here in this Parliament, not only with me, not only with my group, but I think with the vast majority of this Parliament. I have to tell you, giving in to the blackmail of Orbán like it happened in December has to stop now. And also the compromises that have been put on the table to make a yearly portion of that money or to give a mid-term review on that money, or not a compromise, because it’s simply opening the door for more blackmailing, by Orbán in the coming years.  So, the appeal that I want to launch to you, hopefully, I think, in the name of the vast majority of this parliament is stay inside the treaties, and pick up your role that you have as the guardian of the treaties, because there are sufficient solutions to give this money to Ukraine inside the provisions of the treaty of today. You don’t need to, every time, give in to the blackmail of Orbán. You could propose a face-saving emergency clause or break, like we call, it at 27. That could be a solution. Or you could go into an enhanced cooperation, with 26, under the control of the European Parliament, because enhanced cooperation is controlled by the European Parliament. Or ultimately, you can indeed propose to the Council to take away the voting rights based on Article 7(2) of the Treaty, so that we can decide with unanimity on 26. That’s another proposal.  Anyway, I know I have a very bad reputation in this House, and maybe also with you, I don’t know. And I have also, from time to time, a bad character. I’m sometimes even replaced in my positions. But can I ask you one thing – to be a little bit of all that concerning Orbán? And finally, the battle on Hungary is not a battle on Hungary; it’s a battle on the liberal democracy in Europe. And that battle, we need to win it and not to give in on it.","– Madam President, I ask of Ms von der Leyen, can I ask you a very simple question?

163628,"– Madam President, dear colleagues, dear representatives of the Council and the Commission Sometimes in politics, it is worthwhile to take a step back and to look at the bigger picture, and sometimes I ask myself how the European Union looks to others from the outside We stood together in difficult times during the COVID-19 pandemic When Russia brutally invaded Ukraine, we stood at the side of Ukraine and we stood united We should actually right now be considered a strong and meaningful actor in the world, but unfortunately we are not. We are considered too disunited and, by many, also too weak. That is mostly due to one person, one man who we let do whatever he pleases to get what he wants, who we let blackmail and ridicule the rest of the European Union – Viktor Orbán. He attacks minorities, he dismantles press freedom, he dismantles the independence of the judiciary, he weakens Europe, and he disables Europe’s ability to act now vis-à-vis Ukraine. But I can tell you, China is closely watching, obviously, the US and the rest of the world. All for his friend Vladimir Putin and his own pockets. What do the other Member States do? They sit by and let it happen. Big names, important people, presidents, chancellors, prime ministers, they are all too hesitant to do something about it, including the Council President, who has not delivered on something that this Parliament has been asking for for many years now, and that is to move ahead with an Article 7 procedure. What else will you let happen – Hungary becoming even more of an autocracy? Europe becoming weaker and weaker for its own citizens because we are not delivering on the tasks that the citizens demand for the support of Ukraine? Seriously, colleagues, time is up. Ukrainians are losing their lives. Ukrainians are fighting for our freedom too, and we have Putin’s best servant sitting at the table in the European Council, blocking our support and our credibility at this crucial stage. This is a joke, and this is a very bad joke, especially when the Member States actually have the tools to stop this, and not with difficult legal constructions for the financial help of Ukraine – I’m not against it if it is the only way – or to have a proposal for an even dirtier compromise with Orbán. No, the way would be very simply by moving ahead with the Article 7 procedure, not only to defend the rule of law and democracy in Europe, but to make Europe strong in this crucial battle between democracy and autocracy. It is time to do something and the Council has to deliver.","– Madam President, dear colleagues, dear representatives of the Council and the Commission Sometimes in politics, it is worthwhile to take a step back and to look at the bigger picture, and sometimes I ask myself how the European Union looks to others from the outside We stood together in difficult times during the COVID-19 pandemic When Russia brutally invaded Ukraine, we stood at the side of Ukraine and we stood united We should actually right now be considered a strong and meaningful actor in the world, but unfortunately we are not.

163628,"- Lady president, lady president von der leyen, honorable colleagues, the balance of the last European council is, in our opinion, in chiaroscuro we are satisfied with the work that has been done on the enlargement to the western Balkans and on the start of the negotiations for the The entry of Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova Giusta, among other things, the proposal to use the frozen funds for Russia to finance the reconstruction of Ukraine. But some question marks on various issues remain and the revision of the financial framework 2021-2027, on which one has not yet been able to find the necessary unanimity, is still open. Here, the enlargement of the European Union to new nations is certainly important, also because, as often affirmed by President Meloni, it would be more correct to speak of the reunification of Europe. There is a cultural identity, in fact, which even comes before political identity and there is a need to make a common front in the face of the difficult geopolitical challenges of these years. This is why we must not make the tragic error of removing nations that are already part of the European Union, as happened with Great Britain and as it risks happening again. To be even clearer, I find the constant attack on Hungary which, even today, in here, is pouring against her. A political bombing that spares nothing and nobody, not even to Hungarian students who, if an amendment had not been approved yesterday, would have been excluded from the Erasmus program. And this despite the steps forward made by the Magian institutions in the relationship with the Commission, for example regarding the reform of justice. I believe that it should be expected from the institutions of Budapest major solidarity and sharing, but I believe that in return they should offer more willingness to listen to their reasons and the right serenity of judgment. The European Union must be cohesive inside and must regain that centrality in the international chessboard that has lost or that perhaps has never really had. To the old issues related to denatality, to the loss of competitiveness, to the management of migratory flows, many others were added: Chinese and Russian expansionism, Middle Eastern crisis, supply of raw materials and energy, artificial intelligence. President, colleagues, we are already in the election campaign and it would be hypocritical to deny it, but Europe is or is something larger than our small political skills, or it is nothing.","- Lady president, lady president von der leyen, honorable colleagues, the balance of the last European council is, in our opinion, in chiaroscuro we are satisfied with the work that has been done on the enlargement to the western Balkans and on the start of the negotiations for the The entry of Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova Giusta, among other things, the proposal to use the frozen funds for Russia to finance the reconstruction of Ukraine.

163628,"- Lady president, honorable colleagues, happy new year to all! Today I would have liked to talk about the topics discussed to the last European council, however, as colleague Procaccini said, we are and we enter an electoral year and how much I heard today from colleagues forces me and gives me the opportunity to make a wider political reasoning on What will be this year, what they represent and represent the European elections of 2024 from what I feel the premises are no good no one today denies that next year it will be even more difficult than those already difficult we have passed, but in this election campaign , and in the European councils, I would like to hear from the priorities and difficulties that today European citizens face and do not always find us behind the accusation to the parties that I, here in this classroom, represent. I have heard of the populist danger, every plenary session we have absurd debates on the danger of the parties that I represent, but we struggle and above all those who have governed these institutions in the last 30 years ago struggles to understand that the success of the parties that I represent is the result of the your mistakes. It is the result of the policies that you have carried out in the last 30 years; It is also the result of what is then revealed in the meetings of the Council, that is, of a divided Europe that, instead of focusing on a shared method, strength of the positions that then create divisions. We did not do anything extraordinary, we only filled a political space that you have left empty, that you have decided not to fill. Answers to the citizens that we are giving and you have not given your policies. So the problem is not to accuse those who have not ruled of being inefficient or of being dangerous, today the problem you should talk about is the failure of your policies, because if we are voted, we who have never governed in Europe is obviously because i Citizens are not happy and do not feel protected by those who governed today in Europe. 2024 will be very important. As a representative of this political group, I am happy today and I look at the future with optimism because we have already won. What we discuss in this classroom was the result of the fact that our political action led the majority to Europe to discuss certain topics, to talk about immigration, to talk about economy, to approve a reform of the stability and growth pact That finally, even if it is not the best possible, the perspective changes. So a wish to all of a good election campaign and a suggestion: focus on some self -criticism rather than criticizing those who do not want to destroy Europe, but want to free it for years of bad governance.","- Lady president, honorable colleagues, happy new year to all!

163628,"- Madam President, Madam Minister, Mrs. Von Der Leyen, The results are final the reality, it is that you are yielding to the whims of M Orban you play the game of this institutional hostage taking organized by Hungary which blocks help in Ukraine and prevents the revision of the European budget but we will speak frankly. It would be a bit easy to hide behind the escapades of the Hungarian president. We have been saying it for a while now: this European budget is completely insufficient to live up to the social and environmental challenges of the moment. And faced with that, you systematically refused our proposals to increase European Union resources, for example, at random, by putting the multinational and richest that continue, year after year, to raise indecent sums . I will take a single example. In my country, in France, 42 billionaires earned 230 billion euros in a year, the equivalent of a check for € 3,400 for each Frenchman. At the same time, the shareholders received a jackpot of almost 100 billion euros in dividends last year. And on the other side, we have a third of Europeans who jump meals and people who die in the streets of our states. The equation is simple: we have a privileged minority in front of us who are gathered in Davos at the moment - I do not know if you will go, Madame von der Leyen - which are enriched on the back of all the others who s 'impoverish. However, your commission, as well as the right and the liberals of this Parliament systematically refused to seek money, this money where it is by blocking the margins of multinational companies that are enriched and by putting the billionaires who gave himself. Instead, you make people pay, people who are struggling, people by destroying public services, weakening labor law, demanding unjust reforms, pensions and unemployment benefits. What is all for? To satisfy your sacrosanct budgetary rules that bring back austerity. Because in reality, this is the real subject of which nobody speaks today and which should mobilize us all. I launch here the alert. We have before us the greatest cure of budgetary austerity ever seen on our continent. And it does not come from nowhere, Madame von der Leyen, she is your direct responsibility. Seriously, I have a question for you. You do not find that our crèches are not overloaded enough, that 30,000 beds removed from hospitals in my country, in France, since 2017, it is not enough that our hospitals are in very good health, that it does not miss Enough teachers already in our public schools, that our drugs and medical consultations are not already expensive enough, that electricity prices are not high enough and that it is necessary to remove public aid? And there, you said to yourself: with the zealous support of European states, Eurêka! Let's do worse! Let us ask the States to further sacrifice public services. I finish, Madam President, since the president of the group Renew - it is not even the president - Mr. Verhofstadt, had a little more time. I finish, I have for a short time, I promise you. In my country, France, the application of these new budgetary rules will mean cuts in public spending of 22 billion euros per year. So ok, it's only 12% of Bernard Arnault's fortune, but in real life, brought back to the state budget, that will mean the equivalent of the abolition of 623,000 teaching positions. Suffice to say a social massacre, to which you add a democratic scandal, dear colleagues, since a coalition of the social democrats and the liberals and the right together tries to go into force. Perhaps you were inspired by President Macron to import the 49.3 from France to Europe, well, I tell you, we will not let you do.","- Madam President, Madam Minister, Mrs. Von Der Leyen, The results are final the reality, it is that you are yielding to the whims of M Orban you play the game of this institutional hostage taking organized by Hungary which blocks help in Ukraine and prevents the revision of the European budget but we will speak frankly.

166175,"- Dear Mr President, Ms. Commissioner Dalli, dear colleagues! I would like more realism in this debate We all want better air quality for our citizens, affordable mobility for citizens and companies and a competitive industry in the European Union in order to achieve progress in all areas and not to burden anyone about a fee at The Euro 7 standard a healthy middle ground. We have already developed this, this proposal is for voting here today. It improves air quality. Stricter limit values ​​will lead to EUR 70% less fine dust and trucks 60% less nitrogen oxides compared to Euro 6. Mobility remains affordable. Strict limit values ​​and new test procedures require considerable investments, but bring a comparatively low additional benefit for air quality. If we maintain the proven Euro 6 test procedures and only exacerbate the limit values, we prevent high investments in expensive technology that ultimately pays the consumer. We ensure the competitiveness of European industry. It was only at the beginning of this year that the combustion engine was decided in the EU from 2035. We cannot force the auto industry to invest billions in a run -out technology. Climate protection only works with industry, not against it. Air quality and the preservation of competitiveness and jobs in the EU have priority for us. This proposal brings the necessary balance. What is missing is a passage for technology neutrality. CO2-neutral fuels help climate protection. And with which means we achieve climate protection or better air in the end, cannot be prescribed. We need the competition. A ban on certain technology is never targeted. Politicians are not the better engineers. I didn't find any, even with the Greens, even though I was looking for a long time. For this reason, we have brought in changes so that the continued operation of combustion cars that are operated climate-neutral with CO2-neutral fuels is still possible after 2035. Dear colleagues, we found a good compromise. So my appeal to everyone here: Please support this balanced approach for better air, affordable mobility and globally competitive industry.","- Dear Mr President, Ms. Commissioner Dalli, dear colleagues!

166175,"- Mr. President, Mrs. curator, after long negotiations we will be able to vote a Coherent and Balanced Euro 7 standard that takes into account the health of citizens and improves air quality our proposal reduces Nox emissions 60% in trucks, 33% in cars and - for the first time - the contaminating particles of brakes and wheels, in addition to increasing the durability of the batteries. As I say, it is a sensible proposal, with realistic implementation times for the industry and, which is very important, without supplying more costs for consumers. Because I remember that what socialists and green ask here increases the price precisely from the lowest range vehicles and puts more sticks on the wheels to renew the vehicle park so old that it circulates along the roads in many European countries. Not only that: its proposal also puts the manufacture of smaller vehicles at risk - it existed those made in Europe - and, with it, thousands of jobs, for example, in Spain. Therefore, we ask them to support our proposal, which is good for the environment, good for citizens and also good for the competitiveness of Europe.","- Mr. President, Mrs. curator, after long negotiations we will be able to vote a Coherent and Balanced Euro 7 standard that takes into account the health of citizens and improves air quality our proposal reduces Nox emissions 60% in trucks, 33% in cars and - for the first time - the contaminating particles of brakes and wheels, in addition to increasing the durability of the batteries.

166175,"– Mr President, sometimes you have the feeling that the Euro 7 debate was more about the car industry than it is about air quality, although this proposal is there to improve air quality – mainly in our cities, where road transport is still one of the biggest polluters in Europe, and where 70 000 people die prematurely because of bad air quality, because of road transport That’s what we’re trying to address here People are saying, of course, ‘we are trying here, we are moving to electric vehicles and that’s why we don’t need to do this.’ Well, the last standards that we are looking at now, Euro 6, they were formed in 2009, fifteen years ago, and the standards put in place in 2009 already could be met by technologies existing in 2009. What we are doing now is basically reinstalling Euro 6 standards and calling it Euro 7, but are not delivering any improvement on air quality, and at the same time claiming that our citizens will be improving. Is it needed when we are moving to electric? Well, be aware that any combustion engine that is still being sold until 2035 for cars will be on European roads until 2050. For trucks, we don’t even propose the end of the combustion engine, so they will be running on our streets even longer. Is it impossible? Even the Commission’s medium scenario showed the best cost-benefit ratio. The Commission already lowered their proposal, lowered the ambition in that proposal. We even further lower it. So anyone is saying that this is impossible to meet should read the impact assessment. Certainly the conservatives, who always love impact assessments. I think I have a final question to the Commission. If this is being adopted and indeed it is Euro 6, can you please hurry up the negotiations on the green claims, because this will be the best example of a greenwashing label.","– Mr President, sometimes you have the feeling that the Euro 7 debate was more about the car industry than it is about air quality, although this proposal is there to improve air quality – mainly in our cities, where road transport is still one of the biggest polluters in Europe, and where 70 000 people die prematurely because of bad air quality, because of road transport That’s what we’re trying to address here People are saying, of course, ‘we are trying here, we are moving to electric vehicles and that’s why we don’t need to do this.’ Well, the last standards that we are looking at now, Euro 6, they were formed in 2009, fifteen years ago, and the standards put in place in 2009 already could be met by technologies existing in 2009.

166175,"- Mr President, Ms. Commissioner, dear colleagues! Green prohibition policy is omnipresent: first the burner-in-off, then absurd restrictions on the driver's license including night driving ban for beginners, finally a law to restore nature that can paralyze our agriculture We are increasingly busy in this house, these consumer and industrial politics To correct, a policy of de -industrialization of Europe that lowers our prosperity and increases our dependence on other regions of world regions. This is not the case with global environmental protection. But contrary to the opinion of the Greens and Social Democrats, the protection of health, the protection of our European industry and the protection of jobs are not a contradiction - the negotiation result on Euro 7 is the best proof of this. The result is pragmatic and realistic, for three reasons: the air quality is sustainably improved by stricter limit values ​​for exhaust emissions of trucks and buses, through the first regulation of emissions from brake and tire abrasion- this is particularly important for electromobility- but also because older vehicles are replaced by the latest generation combustion engines. The industry remains competitive, the moderate adaptation of the limit values ​​creates the necessary planning security for industry. This is practical and is based on the economic feasibility. And third and last: individual mobility remains affordable. Strict limit values ​​and new test procedures would have made cars significantly more expensive, but only brought a little additional benefit for air quality. Especially in times of crisis such as these, cars must remain affordable for citizens. The voice of reason has won the Euro 7 negotiations. The result is a prime example of how environmental and industrial policy can go hand in hand when we leave green ideology outside. Therefore, I ask you to agree to this trilogy result tomorrow so that we can again shape politics with measure and middle, because clever environmental protection with industry - that works, but against industry - this will be difficult.","- Mr President, Ms. Commissioner, dear colleagues!

So can you not just now already say that you are not going to use Euro 7and just call it what it is? It’s Euro 6. If not, then probably we need your green claims proposal because it will be greenwashing by pretending that we are cleaning up the cars more, although they are not. So let me be very clear on that. But secondly, by failing at the European level with these very efficient source policies, we are pushing all the responsibilities to local communities and to local governments. In the cities, they will be forced to act on it, because it is the people that are breathing bad air in those cities and it is partly because of road transport. And this means that we are now pushing the responsibility to the local governments to put in ‘Umwelt zones’ and all that. And then, of course, the same politicians here agreeing with this will start complaining about it. But that is the result of complacency here, we are pushing the responsibility to there where they can hardly act. And that is a failure of this proposal.

Therefore, it is crucial that our industry be able to develop the world's best zero emission buses and trucks. And with the negotiating result on heavy vehicles, we secure exactly that. We set ambitious demands on the industry and ensure high reduction targets. For 2030, all new city buses will be zero-emissions buses, and by 2040, new trucks that are being sold will have to emit 90 % less CO2 overall. These are crucial signals. Long -term signals that we send today. These are clear signals for our industry so they can plan for that. These are clear signals that will help to secure them a global leadership position, because in the future, electric buses and zero emission trucks will be the cheapest and not least the greenest. The question is not about, but rather when? And I think we're in a hurry! What has happened to our solar cell industry should not also happen to our truck industry. We cannot allow it to happen, and therefore we have to have legislation that makes demands on the market - we cannot leave it to the market myself - but that is why I am also incredibly proud of the deal we have made .

166887,"- Mr. President, Dear colleagues, Mr. Commissioner, I wanted to recall that we are a few days before COP 28 and that this text is absolutely fundamental for trucks and buses, since we are going to decarbonize all of the road transport in Europe , after having done it for cars and vans is therefore a structuring text for the next 20 to 30 years our responsibility, it is to be both ambitious and pragmatic. Ambitious, that means that we should not give in to the objectives and that is why the Renew group will support the initial proposal of the Commission. We are even ready to go a little further, a little faster, to go as much as possible in the decarbonation of road transport. Regarding buses, we also want 100% of new buses that will be sold in cities are zero emissions in 2030. But we are pragmatic on school cars for example, for which technology is less mature and therefore we leave more time for school cars to adapt. And we make sure that the local cities and communities that have invested in biomethane buses can see their investments protected over time. And then there is the question of road transport concerning the specific technology of e-carigants. The vast majority of the Renew group will oppose amendments that want to disrupt this text. As the Commissioner, which is nevertheless part of the PPE group, recalled, as all the truck manufacturers recall, we do not need e-fuels in this text because, precisely, we need e-carigants elsewhere , to decarbonize the airline and the maritime sector.","- Mr. President, Dear colleagues, Mr. Commissioner, I wanted to recall that we are a few days before COP 28 and that this text is absolutely fundamental for trucks and buses, since we are going to decarbonize all of the road transport in Europe , after having done it for cars and vans is therefore a structuring text for the next 20 to 30 years our responsibility, it is to be both ambitious and pragmatic. Ambitious, that means that we should not give in to the objectives and that is why the Renew group will support the initial proposal of the Commission. We are even ready to go a little further, a little faster, to go as much as possible in the decarbonation of road transport. Regarding buses, we also want 100% of new buses that will be sold in cities are zero emissions in 2030. But we are pragmatic on school cars for example, for which technology is less mature and therefore we leave more time for school cars to adapt. And we make sure that the local cities and communities that have invested in biomethane buses can see their investments protected over time. And then there is the question of road transport concerning the specific technology of e-carigants. The vast majority of the Renew group will oppose amendments that want to disrupt this text.

166887,"- Mr. President! Commission members The Climate Crisis is urgent in parts of the transition, it is moving forward, but when it comes to emissions from heavy transport, emissions still increase despite the Paris Agreement, despite a European Climate Act, emissions are still increasing in terms of heavy transport. Therefore, it is extremely important that we make ambitious decisions that ensure that the manufacturers of heavy trucks must reduce their emissions and focus on electrification. Because that is what is the future of heavy transport. But I am concerned that the European right is trying to undermine these decisions and reduce ambitions. It would be very unfortunate, because we already have enough rolling trucks on our streets that emit carbon dioxide and we have to reduce them extremely quickly.","- Mr. President!

166887,"– Mr President, we are all in agreement with our good friend Bas Eickhout – but he's not listening – regarding the need to reduce CO2 emissions on the heavy vehicles But our approach is a pragmatic one, meaning that before we have very ambitious goals and then we do not reach them, we prefer to have very pragmatic goals that we make sure that all the Member States will reach There are three points in which the ECR Group will be fighting on. Number one is the carbon correction factor, which we think is necessary to handle the wide variety of heavy vehicles. Number two is the urban buses. We ran a study in Italy and in most of the largest cities, we reach the goal that is proposed in the text, but most of the smaller cities will not make it because of a whole bunch of different problems, especially on the recharging stations and so on.  And last, neutral fuels. We know Germany – and we hear Peter Liese – they are very strong on synthetic fuels. Italy is very strong on biomasses. We do believe that we need to accept all the different type of less impacting fuels.","– Mr President, we are all in agreement with our good friend [NAME] – but he's not listening – regarding the need to reduce CO2 emissions on the heavy vehicles But our approach is a pragmatic one, meaning that before we have very ambitious goals and then we do not reach them, we prefer to have very pragmatic goals that we make sure that all the Member States will reach There are three points in which the [GROUP] Group will be fighting on.

For what? Well, not for the climate. You said no to biofuels, renewable fuels. We have proposed them. It is therefore clear that industrial policies are hidden behind environmental policies. Oh yes, because then to benefit it will be only China. There will be consequences on companies and entire supply chains. The transport sector, a sector already in difficulty for the economic crisis and the costs of fuels, will be on its knees. There was no impact analysis. There are no valid alternatives for such long sections. And then, for the municipalities, you decided to impose 100% electric for 2030 for public transport. So I wonder, especially the small municipalities, where do you think they can take the money? An electrical bus costs on average five times more. You are putting the future of companies, workers and municipalities at risk only for an ideology.","- Mr. President, honorable colleagues, the green transition must not be an economically and socially unsustainable boulder after cars, you have decided to impose the electric also for heavy vehicles: you have decided to sink companies and entire supply chains.

Of course, there are reasons that can be explained: the increase in demand from many areas of the world after Covid, the reduction of Russian gas. All concrete reasons. But there was more and we cannot deny it. There have certainly been market manipulation actions, if not real financial speculations, and the message that derived from it was very clear: we must intervene and intervene well because this does not happen. The aim is therefore to create more stringent, more effective surveillance rules. And I insisted, together with the rapporteur and other colleagues, so that a leap forward was truly accomplished, so that this reform was not so formal. We do not want - as liberalists fear - manipulating the market, locking it, prevent them from working. We want it to work well to guarantee citizens and businesses, so that the market is not damage but both the place where everything can happen clearly and transparency. We also insisted on putting some transparency rule to non -European operators, because even those must respond to our logic and our criterion of proper functioning.","- President, President, Mrs. Commissioner, Ladies Colleagues, we approve a very important reform, connected to that of the electricity market, the regulation on gas, biomethane and hydrogen, a reform that concerns the protection of the Union - are very demanding words - respect At market manipulations what happened in 2021 and 2022 in wholesale energy markets, with the exorbitant and stratospheric increases of prices, it was a shock.

Unfortunately, as a PPE group, we cannot agree with compulsory medical tests, especially if they are based only on the age criterion, and not on objective health conditions as the only form of verification of the ability to drive. We strongly support the recognition of existing various domestic systems, often more economical and effective. We also cannot agree to the introduction of the EU penalty points system. This is contrary to the treaties, with the principle of subsidiarity. As PPE, we support proposals that make it easier for young people to enter the labor market as a driver, of course, met with strict conditions. Ladies and Gentlemen! I believe that in votes we will reject unacceptable social corrections, and we will accept those whose goal is to improve safety, digest, increase the number of drivers and facilitating especially for young drivers.

165088,"- Mrs. President, Honorable Colleagues, the Report on the revision of the Directive on driving licenses aims to harmonize the requirements for the driving license at the EU, with some news, such as the measures for novice drivers or the new digital license we know well that The most discussion point is that of mandatory medical checks: I consider it one of the fundamental points to guarantee a high level of road safety. In this way, in fact, the physical integrity of a driver is objectively assessed by a qualified professional. I know that in some Member States this does not happen and the medical examination is replaced with self -certification. However, I think that, as legislators, we must always keep the precautionary principle stop and guarantee the highest levels of safety. For example, I think of the control of vision, which is an essential element for a driver, whose loss of diopters is difficult to find with a personal evaluation. For this reason I hope that tomorrow the plenary confirm the position of the Transport Commission and gives a clear signal, I would like to say historian, in favor of greater road safety.","- Mrs. President, Honorable Colleagues, the Report on the revision of the Directive on driving licenses aims to harmonize the requirements for the driving license at the EU, with some news, such as the measures for novice drivers or the new digital license we know well that The most discussion point is that of mandatory medical checks: I consider it one of the fundamental points to guarantee a high level of road safety.

165088,"- Madam President, my dear colleagues, the European Parliament will rule tomorrow on a major text for strengthening road safety in Europe, namely the revision of the Driving Directive This text contains a controversial but necessary measure On which I will extend, it is the establishment of a compulsory medical examination every fifteen years during the administrative renewal of this permit, in order to judge the physical and mental aptitudes of the drivers This systematization of the medical examination, already Established in a number of Member States, is not intended to penalize drivers, but to protect all users of public space. And it is not as such an attack on the driving license. How can we justify that our vehicles can be subject to regular, compulsory and rhythmic technical controls when drivers are never verified? It is, not to attack mobility, but to ensure secure mobility, as was the case with the seat belt, which has been the subject of the same debates as the medical examination 40 years ago, and that nobody would now think of questioning. To those who castigate that Europe intervenes about a driver's license which concerns a whole European space of freedom to circulate, I answer that there is on the contrary an urgent need to harmonize. Finally, I would say that, as legislators, we have the possibility of improving the safety of all users of the public road. We will therefore be accountable by our vote of all the lives which will be won or spoiled or lost.","- Madam President, my dear colleagues, the European Parliament will rule tomorrow on a major text for strengthening road safety in Europe, namely the revision of the Driving Directive This text contains a controversial but necessary measure On which I will extend, it is the establishment of a compulsory medical examination every fifteen years during the administrative renewal of this permit, in order to judge the physical and mental aptitudes of the drivers This systematization of the medical examination, already Established in a number of Member States, is not intended to penalize drivers, but to protect all users of public space.

This says how it was possible, and allow it to say that, of course, with the work of all, otherwise there would not have been this unanimity, without false modesty, with my contribution, my political group, PPE, we were able to reconcile these points Of different sight, for example in the particular case of wine, which had so much discussion. And here, referring to the work that my political group did, which I did as a rapporteur myself, obviously I can't forget the work that all my colleagues did and, naturally, in the person of the rapporteur, ours Colleague Paolo de Castro, who also knew how to perceive and welcome many of the points of view we had. It's a good example - and I hope the European Commission will be particularly attentive - how it is possible to produce legislation that reconciles the various interests in presence. The unanimous vote we had in the agriculture commission is a good lesson of how in politics it is always more important to defend the interests of public policy recipients than only and exclusively ideology. Regarding wine: Obviously, if there are different points of view, we have achieved that, in fact, the specificity of such an important product for the agricultural economy, and so important to several Member States, remained in common agricultural policy in its substantial part . And it is, therefore, with great satisfaction that I see this position of the Agriculture Commission and that I hope that in the votes of tomorrow we can maintain it.","- President, guys and expensive colleagues, the proposal of regulation that we are discussing today derived from negotiations that had difficulties in the face of the specificities and the legitimate interests in question, both the groups of groupings, or the traders and, of course, of the traders and the Points of view here and there different from the various Member States but it is this report that, certainly, tomorrow we will see approved and unanimously was the agriculture Commission. This says how it was possible, and allow it to say that, of course, with the work of all, otherwise there would not have been this unanimity, without false modesty, with my contribution, my political group, PPE, we were able to reconcile these points Of different sight, for example in the particular case of wine, which had so much discussion. And here, referring to the work that my political group did, which I did as a rapporteur myself, obviously I can't forget the work that all my colleagues did and, naturally, in the person of the rapporteur, ours Colleague Paolo de Castro, who also knew how to perceive and welcome many of the points of view we had. It's a good example - and I hope the European Commission will be particularly attentive - how it is possible to produce legislation that reconciles the various interests in presence.

164532,"- Madam President, Mr. Commissioner, dear Paolo, I want to congratulate our colleague, Paolo de Castro, for the work he has done, as well as alternative speakers I think a great job has been done is true that it is a very important regulation. Here most of the regulations regarding geographical indications are unified - not all, there is a part of the wine that remains in the unique OCM. But I believe that the agreement is good, above all, because we are reinforcing a system that not only intends to strengthen a brand, it is not a commercial brand, we all know it: it is culture, tradition, heritage, rural areas, our peoples. This is what this regulation means; It is very, very important. Therefore, I feel proud of the work that has been done by everyone. I know that the commissioner has said that he did not like the place of the USA. We consider that the US can help, but not have a main role. That role has to correspond to the agri DG. That is the opinion of this Parliament and I believe that we must congratulate us all. And finally, I want to add that we have not only reinforced the system: this is the basis of the system and the basis of rural areas. Therefore, let's continue supporting these geographical indications that are clearly a brand of European quality.","- Madam President, Mr. Commissioner, dear Paolo, I want to congratulate our colleague, Paolo de Castro, for the work he has done, as well as alternative speakers I think a great job has been done is true that it is a very important regulation.

164532,"- Madam President, the Commissioner, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur, Dear Paolo, thank you and thank all the political groups for their constructive work on this file which received a full vote in the Agriculture Agriculture Committee I therefore invite you, dear colleagues, to support this text in its version during the vote of tomorrow I believe that this report will allow us to approach the trilogues in the strength position. I particularly salute the compromise that we have found to preserve the specificity of wine, which is a key sector in terms of geographic indication. If I understand what Mr. Commissioner said about administrative simplification, we must wonder who is intended for. Is it administrative simplification for the Commission or for producer organizations? For me, it’s clearly for producers. So I fought to find a balanced solution that also takes into account the need to simplify these procedures. And I now hope that the ""wine"" package contained in this report will be well received by the Council. Wine has always played an avant-garde role in improving the IG regime and it would be a shame to condemn it to stagnation. I also deliver that Parliament has spoken against the outsourcing of IG management tasks, which must remain in the hands of the CEO Agri of the Commission. The quality product system is a key element of the CAP, the transfer of functions to Euipo was a dangerous precedent. Thank you all. Good vote tomorrow.","- Madam President, the Commissioner, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur, Dear Paolo, thank you and thank all the political groups for their constructive work on this file which received a full vote in the Agriculture Agriculture Committee I therefore invite you, dear colleagues, to support this text in its version during the vote of tomorrow I believe that this report will allow us to approach the trilogues in the strength position.

164532,"- Madam President, Mr. Commissioner, Dear colleagues, I too will start by thanking the rapporteur Paolo what a success this evening! And if all the rapporteurs had such a success in their files for all the work done and all the collaboration with the fictitious rapporteurs around the file, it was really a pleasure to work on this file the geographic indications are part of our common European heritage and This report aims to protect it as much as possible. Several points that I will mention here go in this direction. First of all, the CEO of the Commission preserves its role in the approval or the opposition of the granting of an IG. We have indeed, and in block, refused that the Euipo obtain this prerogative. It was important that Europe remains master of the game on the management of a heritage as precious as that of the IG. We have enabled recognized producer groups to have decision -making power in their specifications. And it also seemed to us something important for wine. For the sake of consistency, the IG of wine will remain in the OCM, we agree enough on this. And finally, the last point which was particularly close to my heart, on which we were unfortunately not far enough: it is the commitments of sustainability which are made on the basis of volunteering. This is not a bad thing, but we did not go far enough on the subjects that can be objects of this durability, climate, biodiversity, etc. But I trust quality actors to bring these concerns quickly into their concerns. And I also invite to vote for this text.","- Madam President, Mr. Commissioner, Dear colleagues, I too will start by thanking the rapporteur Paolo what a success this evening!

164532,"- Madam President, Mr. Commissioner, I still do not understand why the commission insists on proposing a reform that adds more bureaucracy to a system of geographical indications that works perfectly and that is very important for the agricultural sector and as some of my colleagues and They have heard me say, I always say that, if something works, the possible transfer of the management of these regimes of the European Union to the Intellectual Property Office of the European Union, the famous Euipo is not touched, is not a good idea . It has to be and should be the agri DG, which knows well the products and agricultural reality, who must continue to be the valid interlocutor for these geographical indications. The commission is filled by his mouth talking about sustainability, but I would like to remind him that, without profitability, there cannot be that sustainability. And that does not need to remind the producers, most of which are small and medium -sized companies, who know very well what this means, because, if not, they should close. The report of my colleague Paolo de Castro has faithfully collected the concerns of all members of this working group of the Commission for Rural Agriculture and Development and corrects the commission document that, as usual, moves away from the reality of the field and farmers. I also want to thank the rest of my colleagues for their good disposition and have reached a point where we all agree.","- Madam President, Mr. Commissioner, I still do not understand why the commission insists on proposing a reform that adds more bureaucracy to a system of geographical indications that works perfectly and that is very important for the agricultural sector and as some of my colleagues and They have heard me say, I always say that, if something works, the possible transfer of the management of these regimes of the European Union to the Intellectual Property Office of the European Union, the famous Euipo is not touched, is not a good idea .

Prosecco and balsamic vinegar cases will no longer have to repeat themselves. Mr. Commissioner, I no longer want to hear from some people who work in the DG Agri who cannot be confused these wines because one drinks with food and the other is drunk with the dessert. For this reason we have included two amendments to defend our geographical indications. As we we will fight on all European tables. Since then she cited the role of the UUPIO, she must remember that the vote was unanimous, that it is a clear message to her and the commission in general too. Our group will maintain a firm position regarding the role of the UUIPO, wanting to limit the transfer of proxies from the DG Agri. We do not want to be transformed, let's say, the competence and being politically sensitive to the subject, we will continue to fight so that the provisions of the most important wine sector remain within the CAP to allow more slender reviews and have more protection.","-President President, honorable colleagues, greeting the speaker Ombra de Castro, the commissioner and colleagues of this dossier as a shadow rapporteur and on behalf of the [PARTY]-Salvini Premier, I emphasize that we vote in favor, as we have already done in the commission, of this Revision proposal because it is fundamental for the sector, fundamental for Italy, which also holds the largest number of agri -food products recognized by the Union.

164532,"- Madam President, Mr. Commissioner, geographical indications are a greatly useful rural development instrument generate added value in agricultural products, benefit primary producers and contribute to the support of employment allow our society to understand that things not only are worth it same, but also because of the way they occur, due to their links with the territory, the best traditions and the common knowledge, therefore, geographical indications are not limited to protecting a name, but are, above all, an instrument of Agrarian policy The system that we have had so far has given very good results, but this report improves them. It reinforces the role of producers' groups, keeps the wine sector in the framework of the common agricultural policy, awards to the EUIP the appropriate role and makes it clear that, when we talk about geographical indications, we do not speak only of marks in competition, but of The people behind, the activities they share and the resources they maintain, which is not just about regulating markets or awarding prices, but about protecting intangible goods from incalculable value. Perhaps a more forceful bet in favor of sustainability, but congratulations, lord of Castro, and congratulations to all speakers. It has been a great job and we will vote in favor.","- Madam President, Mr. Commissioner, geographical indications are a greatly useful rural development instrument generate added value in agricultural products, benefit primary producers and contribute to the support of employment allow our society to understand that things not only are worth it same, but also because of the way they occur, due to their links with the territory, the best traditions and the common knowledge, therefore, geographical indications are not limited to protecting a name, but are, above all, an instrument of Agrarian policy The system that we have had so far has given very good results, but this report improves them.

168504,"- Lady president, honorable colleagues we today have a quantity of waste at European level that derive from packaging that certainly does not justify a regulatory intervention such as what we are discussing, also because the vast majority of these packaging waste is already perfectly inserted in the supply chain Therefore, the risk that we run is that this regulation, so full -bodied and so difficult, goes to apply to a percentage of less than 2% of the total of the waste produced. You understand that it is therefore not justified and seriously dedicating so many months to a discipline in a sector in which, for safety reasons, especially in the food sphere, and healthy, the results obtained by the European Union are already many and very high, Very interesting, very sustainable. It is true, there are no same results in all 27 member countries: we have countries that have achieved great results on recycling, other more poor countries, if we want, perhaps more effective in the reuse sector. What is certain is that the best practices related to recycling cannot be disadvantaged, how this regulation would claim to do, however, introducing a concept of recycling that is completely unfounded from a scientific point of view and not based on the great principle that we support and that We also supported in this negotiation of neutrality on materials. The theme of the closed cycle, from the point of view of high quality recycling, is a theme to be overcome. There are materials in which the closed cycle can be implemented: from the bottle returns to the bottle. But there are materials like that of the paper, which we have so strongly supported, for which the closed cycle is not applicable, so it takes an open cycle to have high levels of recycling. So there are several themes that cross. The first is respect for the performance of individual countries; The second is the protection of excellent performances in the recycling sector to protect healthy healthiness and safety. For this reason we ask that this negotiation closes in the sense of reality, as said by many other colleagues, not depressing the potential in terms of research that many countries have been able to demonstrate.","- Lady president, honorable colleagues we today have a quantity of waste at European level that derive from packaging that certainly does not justify a regulatory intervention such as what we are discussing, also because the vast majority of these packaging waste is already perfectly inserted in the supply chain Therefore, the risk that we run is that this regulation, so full -bodied and so difficult, goes to apply to a percentage of less than 2% of the total of the waste produced.

168504,"- Ms. President, dear colleagues! I received mail last week or had a conversation with the 12-year-old students Anna and Sabine from Düsseldorf. They were annoyed that so much packaging waste is made in the fruit and vegetable department of the supermarket and asked myself as a politician On the other hand, it is actually reality that Sabine and Anna are right, we consume far too much packaging waste, whether individually packaged cucumber, to-go coffee cardboard cup or the oversized packages of online retailers since 2010 has grown by 20% consumption in the EU. Every year alone collects 225 kilograms of packaging waste every year, which is about as much as three washing machines weigh - you have to imagine that. Like Sabine and Anna, many people in Europe are annoyed. An overwhelming majority of the population requires us to reduce the packaging mountains. I would like the voices of consumers to be heard as much in this house here as some fast food chains. I have never been showered by so many lobby inquiries; Some have exceeded the limits of legitimate. With pseudoserious, unscientific fake studies you sow doubts about the regulation and you must not be successful tomorrow. We can focus on the waste hierarchy tomorrow, primarily reduce our material consumption, because we cannot recycle ourselves from our garbage mountains. For this we need more reuses, bans from really unnecessary packaging and rules against oversized packaging. We can make packaging that cannot be avoided more sustainably - also an economic stimulus program for the recycling industry, because from 2030 all the packaging must be recyclable and more recycled material must occur in plastic bags, bottles and boxes. We can protect consumers by banishing health and bisphenol from packaging that come into contact with our food. Sabine and Anna gave me their hope, namely that several MPs take their voices seriously. And tomorrow will decide who coordinates whom in this house.","- Ms. President, dear colleagues!

168504,"– Madam President, colleagues, it shouldn’t be a surprise to you that the junk food barons are not a reliable source of environmental advice, that lobbyists for plastic corporations are not authorities on sustainability Yet, here we are, debating whether we should or should not tackle the mountain of packaging waste piling up in our towns and cities, all because of the corporate embrace of throwaway single-use culture Despite what those men in nice suits tell you, we cannot recycle our way out of this mess. If your single-use plastic cup is recycled into a single-use plastic bag, it is not sustainable. If your plastic junk is swapped for cardboard junk, it is not sustainable. If we continue to generate levels of waste at current rates, that is, by definition, unsustainable. So, colleagues, we have to pull the brakes on our throwaway society, the empty cardboard shipping boxes, the single-serving shampoo bottle for your single-serving hotel experience, the plastic wrapping for a single piece of fruit. All this plastic is cheap. This cardboard is cheap. This packaging is cheap. But the price for our future is very, very high indeed.","– Madam President, colleagues, it shouldn’t be a surprise to you that the junk food barons are not a reliable source of environmental advice, that lobbyists for plastic corporations are not authorities on sustainability Yet, here we are, debating whether we should or should not tackle the mountain of packaging waste piling up in our towns and cities, all because of the corporate embrace of throwaway single-use culture Despite what those men in nice suits tell you, we cannot recycle our way out of this mess.

And here I refer obviously - but you all know - to the fact that Italy and Belgium are strong on recycling and separate collection, other countries are strong on incinerators and so on. In addition, the impact assessments were made but in my opinion they are a bit scarce, in the sense that they have not looked at the social part well, nor the economic part and, in some cases, not even the environmental part. So it is important on this in my opinion to do it again. The minimum recycled content-and this something I say to the powerful commissioner-is a problem because there are already estimates according to which there will be a growth in the cost of recycled material in Europe of 120-180%, according to the various estimates of the and others. To conclude, the problem here is that, among the cost increases on transport - and today we have voted the issue of CO2 emissions of heavy vehicles - and the increase in costs relating to, we are downloading the European user and the European citizen A 10% increase in supermarkets. So, in my opinion, we are truly crazy, because the European citizen does not understand this.","- Mrs. President, honorable colleagues, then the [GROUP] group obviously agrees on the objective of reducing the amount of the and above all material but above all, from my point of view, to reduce the volume that goes to landfills and incinerators this It is important for all of Europe, both for the environment but also from an economic point of view on this regulation, as we discussed in the Envi Commission, there are three points that I don't particularly like: the first that is a regulation and not one Directive, for which it leaves no type of space to the nations to decide if they want to follow a certain road rather than another.

168504,"-Mr. President, it is undeniable the need to reduce over-in-depths this requires an intervention on production and marketing, aiming to limit the use of products without any use, as well as the effective reduction of production and use of disposable and useless products We reject a logic in which the end consumer is transferred to the responsibility and options of options that the industry does not want to counteract. A better and more adequate management of urban waste goes through public management of the sector, which implies the reversal of privatization processes and the recovery of public control throughout the sector. In this regard, it is important to consider the diversity of starting points in the Member States, which imply different efforts to meet the established goals. Therefore, the established goals and the intensity of implementation must be adequate to each Member State, ensuring the necessary temporal flexibility for the feasibility of fulfilling the objectives defined by the country, and the reinforcement of the means at the disposal of the Member States, particularly from the that have lower collection and recycling levels to promote the necessary investments for training and infrastructure for this purpose.","-Mr. President, it is undeniable the need to reduce over-in-depths this requires an intervention on production and marketing, aiming to limit the use of products without any use, as well as the effective reduction of production and use of disposable and useless products We reject a logic in which the end consumer is transferred to the responsibility and options of options that the industry does not want to counteract.

163767,"- Chairman, Dear Commissioner, Colleagues, the fifth revision of the Kidenskindiging Substances Directive is extremely important for the health of one hundred thousand employees who are regularly exposed to lead and the 4.2 million employees who come into contact with diisocyanates in Europe I am Satisfied that tomorrow we can vote for a balanced agreement where the health of employees has the highest priority, but at the same time gives the chance to our own European lead and battery sector to help achieve the climate objectives. We go to a lead value that is up to five times lower than the dated limit value of 1982. We record a limit value for the first time for diisocyanates. We have also found a solution for employees who have historically high lead values ​​in their blood. The agreement also provides better education and awareness about the health effects for employees, in particular for women. Moreover, the Kidenskensgaren Guideline is further expanded with, among other things, hormone -disrupting substances. In addition, there are initiatives for better protection of firefighters against the exposure to carcinogenic substances. The agreement also focuses on additional measures against the so -called cocktail effect. I therefore explicitly ask you to vote for the Trilogue Agreement tomorrow and the Member States to convert the Directive as soon as possible, so that 4.3 million employees can benefit from a safer workplace. Finally - this was actually the last file on health and safety at the work of this session - I would like to thank the Commissioner and colleagues, in particular over the party borders, for the particularly good cooperation. I think there are few files when it comes to the protection of employees in the workplace where there is such a consensus over the party borders, where we have been able to shoulder, always with the same people, with the same rapporteurs and shadow reporters, to shoulder, always shoulder to collaborate. It is therefore very nice to be able to complete those files in a positive way. And of course with our colleague-unfortunately-Véronique Trillet-Lenoir in mind.

163767,"- Mrs. Speaker! The term of office has led to many important reinforcements of the working environment in Europe We have pushed through stronger legislation that better protects workers against asbestos, a new work environment strategy in Europe and better conditions for seasonal workers and personnel in the rescue service now we will also make decisions on strengthened protection against carcinogenic substances And dangerous chemicals such as lead and diisocyanates in the workplace. I want to take the opportunity to thank the rapporteur, Nikolai Wilhelmsen, and my colleagues in the committee for good cooperation. Despite the great success of the term of office, we still have a long way to hike to protect Europe's employees. In Sweden, 62 people died in workplace accidents last year. It is the highest figure in twelve years. Each year, over 200,000 workers in Europe die as a result of work -related diseases caused by, among other things, asbestos, quartz dust and hazardous chemicals. The zero vision against fatal accidents at work should permeate everything we do. But it must also include life after the end of the working day. No worker should be exposed to health risks that have consequences later in life. The requirements for education and competence for those who work with dangerous subjects must be strengthened with the help of the social partners. We will stop the cheating with the working environment. Set stricter requirements for safeguard measures in public procurement. Cheating with work environment should never be able to provide competitive advantages. We Social Democrats will always stand for a policy that puts employees 'health over the companies' profit hunting. Our goal is clear. No one should risk getting sick or dying because of their work.","- Mrs. Speaker!

But in many factories, those employees are of course exposed to several hazardous substances at the same time. There is actually no protection against that combined exposure today.

168485,"- President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues! With that we are now lying a foundation for an active green industrial policy. This is correct, because the huge European green deal also needs a clean industry and also investments here on site that is an important step to ensure the competitiveness of our manufacturers here. Because European manufacturers should also benefit more from public orders in the future. We want to create sustainable jobs and accelerate the transition to climate neutrality. This should be improved with both with this law. This also becomes more independent of imports in critical industries, because we, for example, need a strong solar industry here in Europe and not just in China. We cannot just stand by and see how our manufacturers migrate to the United States or when Chinese panels flood the market here. That also costs jobs. With me in Saxony, there are prominent manufacturers who are therefore considering putting their investments back or closing their factories. But I think it can only be a start. We need more. We had actually hoped for a European sovereign fund. Ms. von der Leyen announced that. Unfortunately it has only become a little step. We now have that, we have steps where there is not enough money in it. I think we need something bigger. We need public money, we need planning acceleration, we also need better award policy, and so we can also support people. Because we see: people want transformation, especially people in the transformation regions, they want to tackle this transformation. The first is to be created in Lusatia, in Brandenburg, in Saxony, there is great enthusiasm. But we have to support them. That's why we're here.

Fortunately, all this arrived at the terminus. Today is the last day of this legislature and I hope that European citizens can change. Let me close with a thank you of this legislature, first of all, to my staff Mario, Cristina, Maria Elena, Lorenzo, Giovanni and Gaetano, who have contributed to doing an extraordinary job and thanks to my group leader [NAME] and my president [NAME] and a All colleagues with whom I had the pleasure and honor of collaborating in this legislature. Good luck to all."

F-gases are used in a variety of everyday products such as refrigerators, climate systems, heat pumps, heat pumps, asthma sprays, fire extinguishers-to name only a few-also used in the construction industry or in switchgear of our electricity supply systems, refrigerants play an important role in this synthetic refrigerant, the so-called F-gases , have an alarming high greenhouse potential, which is up to 25,000 times more climate-damaging than CO2, so these substances have to be drastically reduced and replaced with natural refrigerants if we want to seriously combat climate change with the dossier for F-gases, the ozone regulation is also linked closely . In the past, we have seen in the past that excellent results can be achieved with clear, binding regulations. With the successful completion of the interinstitutional negotiations, we strengthen the Green Deal. In my role as a shadow rapporteur to revise the F-GAS regulation, I am therefore pleased to be able to report today that we have successfully tackled this important paradigm shift. A big thank you to all colleagues for the really good and constructive cooperation, especially to the rapporteur Bas Eickhout. Both production and consumption are gradually reduced according to a strict schedule with decreasing quota assignments. As far as the consumption is concerned, these will even be fully set by 2050. The text available for coordination is an important contribution to climate protection and to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. In addition, the revised regulation strengthens the leading role of European companies on the world markets for climate-friendly technologies and makes us F-Gases, especially in the USA and Asia. We strengthen the industrial location of Europe and are already securing tomorrow's jobs. According to calculations, around 80% of the F-GAS emissions of 2050 would come from inpatient and mobile cold and air conditioning systems. These emissions can be avoided because they can be replaced by climate -friendly natural refrigerants and are also replaced. By 2050, a total of 500 million tons of CO2 will be saved by the stricter regulation of the F-GAS Ordinance and the Ozon Ordinance, which is also available for coordination. A really great success!","- Dear President, an estimated commissioner, colleagues!

We are known from time to time to have different positions, but Bas has always remained constructive and from time to time even inclusively democratic. So, Bas, many thanks for it. But now, seriously, I was not happy, and I would even say I was a little shocked, when I saw the proposal from the European Commission, which was mainly driven by ideology and ambitions. In fact, it was imposing a risk on the availability of asthma medical inhalers, and the availability of heat pumps at a time of growing demand and a project called REPowerEU, and also some risk for the electricity grid. So it was not a good situation. I was even more shocked when some colleagues from the European Parliament wanted to go even further, just to be, let’s say, more ambitious than the European Commission, without seeing the full picture. But in the end, I must say that I’m happy with the final proposal, because I think we have succeeded, finally, to balance and to protect European citizens and businesses from, let’s say, unrealistic ambitions. And we strike a balance that’s very important between existing and emerging, more sustainable technologies. So it’s a good proposal in the end. We don’t impose a major risk on the energy and healthcare sectors within the EU, and I’m happy for this.","– Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues, for ozone-depleting substances I think we have reached a very good deal We will protect more the ozone layer, which is perfect, and I would like to thank the rapporteur, [NAME] On fluorinated gases, I would also like to start by thanking the rapporteur, [NAME].

162974,"- Mr. President! When we look back in the late 80s, when we began to understand the problem of an ever thinner ozone layer, what we often at the poles usually describe as an ozone hole what we did then, it is often highlighted as a good example of How politics can really listen to science and bring in the alarm reports that existed when what happened was that the countries of the world agreed that we needed to phase out these dangerous substances that break down the ozone high up in the stratosphere many miles up in the atmosphere that time listened We really at the research and took these alarm reports seriously. But we have a lot to learn from that work, what happened then. It is exactly the type of process that we should have in other environmental and nature and climate issues as well. The work on the Montreal Protocol that landed in the late 1980s, it is not over, because there are still some emissions of substances that are not regulated, and new substances are not available at that time. And there are also, as some other speakers have said, too, clear links between these substances that break down the ozone layer and the climate issue. On the one hand, we have some of these substances that are extremely potent greenhouse gases: they can be thousands, up to 22,000 times worse per molecule than the carbon dioxide is. But in addition, we have the big problem that when the greenhouse effect is strengthened, it gets warmer down here at the ground surface but at the same time colder up in the stratosphere where the ozone layer is located. And if that cooling off, there is a great risk that the healing of the ozone layer will take much, much longer. Therefore, if we want to take the ozone problem seriously, we must also take the climate issue even more seriously and learn from the ambitions that we have made after all until now when it comes to the ozone layer and do the same on other issues.","- Mr. President!

162974,"- Mr. President! The latest area on which the EU wants to introduce new standards is in refrigerators, air conditioning and heat pumps, including a ban on F-gases, but what will really happen if 3,000 models of heat pumps currently on the market are suddenly replaced with models Without f-gases? 1.3 million Swedish households today have a heat pump. How many of these households will be forced to switch to a new heat pump in the near future? The pumps will not only be more expensive, but there will also be fewer units on the market. Many consumers will end up in the following situation; That you want to buy a new heat pump for the winter. Then place yourself in the queue because there will be no until next summer. Yes, it is good to promote innovation, but prohibitions that ignore the technical feasibility and consumer's ability to pay are harmful. What the EU calls ambition, ambitious and innovative is in fact a severe blow to citizens. Many have chosen heat pumps just because they produce heat in a very cheap and efficient way without having dirty and toxic emissions. The EU should therefore promote the use of more heat pumps instead of making it more difficult.","- Mr. President!

162974,"- Mr. President, honorable colleagues, the trilogy was long but in the end he prevailed the reason on too ideological positions nobody denies attention to environmental protection, nor do we criticize research in alternative technologies, indeed: the doubts still present derive from many comparisons had with the actors of the F-Gas sector. I repeat: reducing greenhouse gases and looking for more sustainable and natural solutions in the refrigeration and heat pumps sector is our vision. The problem is the fundamentalism of some souls of this parliament. How is it possible to ask to eliminate F-Gas switching to more dangerous technologies such as flammable gases? Why do some want to impose prohibitions and deadlines too close if there are no technological solutions available? Fortunately, the Council reported balance with respect to the initial forecasts. It will be decisive to evaluate in the next mandate if this legislation will live up to the expectations of operators, actors and the environment. Two considerations. The first, in the European Union we are at the forefront in refrigeration; Do we want it to hurry ideological choices affect a sector of excellence? Do we not think that companies and workers need clear, clear, defending the environment without neglecting to defend their business? The second: we widen our gaze. Do you really think that with regulations so stringent and unrelated to the technological context will we be competitive in the international scenario? There are already quite quite aggressive commercial practices around us; How to support production and research of our companies if we do not create the suitable conditions? I conclude. There are a few months in the European elections, citizens ask us more and more to use reason and weighting in the choices, especially in those that touch everyday life. We therefore replace the various ideologies a pragmatic approach that protects, workers and our productions.","- Mr. President, honorable colleagues, the trilogy was long but in the end he prevailed the reason on too ideological positions nobody denies attention to environmental protection, nor do we criticize research in alternative technologies, indeed: the doubts still present derive from many comparisons had with the actors of the F-Gas sector. I repeat: reducing greenhouse gases and looking for more sustainable and natural solutions in the refrigeration and heat pumps sector is our vision. The problem is the fundamentalism of some souls of this parliament. How is it possible to ask to eliminate F-Gas switching to more dangerous technologies such as flammable gases? Why do some want to impose prohibitions and deadlines too close if there are no technological solutions available? Fortunately, the Council reported balance with respect to the initial forecasts. It will be decisive to evaluate in the next mandate if this legislation will live up to the expectations of operators, actors and the environment. Two considerations.

162974,"- Chairman, thanks to both rapporteurs for their excellent work During my youth, I heard ominous reports about the hole in the ozone layer almost daily in the news and that led to action, among other things, CFKs were very quickly restricted refrigerators and spray cans are long free free Of these floating gases the Montreal protocol to save the ozone layer is a good example of the fact that if we put our shoulders to the wheel together, we can solve problems. The ozone layer is recovering in response to the Montreal protocol. Yet substances that affect the ozone layer and break down remains a great concern. Especially since they contribute so much to the climate crisis. Good steps are taken with this bill to tackle that. But we have to make much more work on replacing ozone -breaking gases that are used in production processes. The use of these types of substances for the production of plastic and pesticides, among other things, cannot be justified. With regard to the Party for the Animals, this stops quickly. Rather today than tomorrow.","- Chairman, thanks to both rapporteurs for their excellent work During my youth, I heard ominous reports about the hole in the ozone layer almost daily in the news and that led to action, among other things, CFKs were very quickly restricted refrigerators and spray cans are long free free Of these floating gases the Montreal protocol to save the ozone layer is a good example of the fact that if we put our shoulders to the wheel together, we can solve problems.

164582,"– Mr President, Vice-President, Commissioner, colleagues, it was a pleasure to work on this report at this time European enlargement policy is a powerful tool to promote democracy, the rule of law, respect of fundamental rights It also gives the EU a stronger voice on the world stage For aspiring countries, a credible, merit-based prospect of EU membership is the key driver of transformation. Striving to join the European Community, they see the EU membership as a geostrategic investment in prosperity, stability and security based on common European values. Becoming part of the largest single market in the world opens doors for businesses to expand, innovate, invest and create new jobs. Recent rebooting of the enlargement policy after the aggression of Russia has a geopolitical logic. It will expand the democratic space on our continent and make it clear to Russia what is our preferred political order in Europe. But there are risks. The end of the war is unpredictable. We failed to isolate Russia globally, and we must spare no effort to avoid a decline of support for Ukraine. European enlargement has always been a ‘win-win’ situation for the Union and the newcomers. To ensure it this time, the EU must make its institutional and structural frameworks fit for purpose. The EU has committed to stand with Ukraine every step of the way towards the end of the war and the accession. We expect from the Commission to step up the efforts and proceed swiftly and timely with all the phases of accession process, and provide the negotiating framework by mid-March. Indeed, history is watching us.","– Mr President, Vice-President, Commissioner, colleagues, it was a pleasure to work on this report at this time European enlargement policy is a powerful tool to promote democracy, the rule of law, respect of fundamental rights It also gives the EU a stronger voice on the world stage For aspiring countries, a credible, merit-based prospect of EU membership is the key driver of transformation.

164582,"– Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues, yes, this report that was built with a big consensus between the political parties is also pointing out on the criteria that we need to apply when it comes to new membership candidates Yes, there’s also geostrategic reasons for us to speed up the candidacy process, but we, in this report, state very clearly that Copenhagen criteria have to be the basis of negotiation and of an accession process Also, we need to start to reward countries that have a full alignment with our security and foreign policy. We need to reward those that align, but we also need to set consequences for the ones that do not align, because we also have candidate applicants that are actively cooperating with China, that are actively aligning their security and foreign policy with Russia, that are backtracking on democratic standards like election law. There we need to be consequent and also withdraw funds from these countries, because otherwise the process of accession is not a trustworthy one, if you do not reward the ones that deliver. We need to look towards the East, and we need to look towards the new big candidate countries. First of all, the support for Ukraine needs to be uncontested and there is some additional work to do. Because unfortunately we cannot rely on the support that will be coming from the US: who knows how these presidential elections end. We need to take responsibility within the European Union, within our States, and support Ukraine to defend this illegal invasion into the country.

164582,"– Mr President, saying that enlargement necessitates EU centralisation via treaty change is a blatant lie Such claim is factually wrong and biased, both politically and ideologically Enlargement is just a false pretext to build, as planned, a European superstate to replace the European Union of today. The ultimate proof of it is that planned reform proposes to preserve, not to eliminate, the veto on decision on enlargement. The vast scientific empirical research which has been analysing the impact of previous enlargements – from the early years until the last one – on the functioning of the EU institutions, proves that the enlargement had no negative effect on the decision-making capacity of the EU. It is also confirmed by the documents of the Council secretariat. On the contrary, empirical data prove that the speed of decision-making has actually increased. Moreover, various serious academic studies demonstrate that, after each enlargement, decision-making was faster when there were more Member States. Additionally, experts say that with a view to enlargement, you should decentralise, not further centralise. Centralising reform is not necessary thus, and would be counterproductive in that respect.","– Mr President, saying that enlargement necessitates EU centralisation via treaty change is a blatant lie Such claim is factually wrong and biased, both politically and ideologically Enlargement is just a false pretext to build, as planned, a European superstate to replace the European Union of today.

164582,"- Mr. President, dear colleagues, we discuss one last time before the European elections for the widening of the European Union, which you wish to extend to the Balkan countries to Georgia, via Moldova, Ukraine And even Turkey therefore allow me, too, one last time, to remember why we are firmly opposed it first, we do not want to revise the treaties, because you want to delete the rule of unanimity, and therefore delete the States' right of veto when it comes to joining a new country or not in the European Union. This goes against universal suffrage, against the will of the peoples and therefore of democracy, a value to which you are so attached when, obviously, it suits you. Second, we oppose these enlargements because they compromise the security of our nations and compatriots. How could we be reassured by integrating into Europe Albania and its mafia, Kosovo and its Islamist majority, Ukraine in the midst of war and which we know, on the other hand, its adhesion would sign the death of our French farmers, or Turkey who, with its 85 million inhabitants, would become the most populous country in Europe and threaten the balance of our civilization? Finally, this ideological obsession that you have to want to integrate what does not correspond to our roots and our values ​​would accentuate the migratory submersion which we know is at home, not a problem, but a project. Stop all this! It is a Europe of independent and sovereign nations that we claim. It is a Europe of free peoples whose speech is respected that we want. In this, we were completely opposed and, on June 9, we will give the floor to the peoples.","- Mr. President, dear colleagues, we discuss one last time before the European elections for the widening of the European Union, which you wish to extend to the Balkan countries to Georgia, via Moldova, Ukraine And even Turkey therefore allow me, too, one last time, to remember why we are firmly opposed it first, we do not want to revise the treaties, because you want to delete the rule of unanimity, and therefore delete the States' right of veto when it comes to joining a new country or not in the European Union.

164582,"- Mr. President, dear colleagues, I find that we are going a little quickly in work I do not dispute, obviously, the usefulness of an in -depth debate on the institutional consequences of a hypothetical enlargement, but I ask the question: that Will the public opinion think of this eagerness to want to adapt Europe to the adhesion of eight new countries with 60 million inhabitants? This haste gives the impression that there is no more debate, that enlargement is made and that we have already moved on. But precisely, the expansion is debated and there are a number of reluctance among Europeans. First, from a social point of view; Integrating countries into so low wages can only worsen social dumping into Europe. There is also the question of the feasibility of enlargement. What will become, for example, agricultural policy, if we attach Ukraine? How will our farmers get out of it, who are already suffering from the abolition of customs duties on poultry and cereals? How can we finance this constant budget enlargement, knowing that new countries cannot afford to contribute? I find no serious answer to these legitimate questions, and I think that we do not do a service to the European project by pretending that these questions did not arise.","- Mr. President, dear colleagues, I find that we are going a little quickly in work I do not dispute, obviously, the usefulness of an in -depth debate on the institutional consequences of a hypothetical enlargement, but I ask the question: that Will the public opinion think of this eagerness to want to adapt Europe to the adhesion of eight new countries with 60 million inhabitants?

164582,"– Madam President, Commissioner, colleagues – and indeed no Council, which is a shame What is EU enlargement about? At its core, it’s about improving people’s lives, about finishing the work that we started over 70 years ago: creating the large zone of democracy and rule of law on our continent It has been our most successful foreign policy instrument, and it became a geopolitical necessity now to protect ourselves and our neighbours against autocracy and continued instability But the EU itself needs to improve as well. It is up to us to make sure these two things go hand in hand in the interest of old and new citizens alike. We have an opportunity to turn the upcoming accession of countries into a win-win situation, strengthening and reforming our Union, while at the same time living up to our promises towards candidate countries. We have to ensure that the one process will not be hijacked by the other. We cannot have a situation that candidates have implemented all reforms, but we are not ready. Let’s unleash all creativity to reform and complete our Union as soon as possible. The citizens of Kyiv, Pristina and Tirana are Europeans. They want their democracies protected, want clean air, fair wages, freedom of choice, fundamental rights. They want a better life.

164584,"- Ms. President, dear Commissioner, valued colleagues! This week we will decide a new law on data exchange between online rental platforms and national authorities and I am looking forward to this for two very special reasons first: We solve a long known problem all of us know Airbnb and Co. Many people like to use them to accommodate To find or to rent yourself and this coexistence of private and commercial providers is now quite normal but - and that is the point here - everyone has to play according to the same rules and while there are strict requirements for commercial accommodation companies, the platform rental could often do not determine who rents where in whom and over and over what period. And that has become increasingly a problem that has become a big problem. And depending on the member country or region, the situation became more and more difficult to see. And now the rules are clear. Now the rules are uniform and we have free travel for transparency and fair competition. Secondly, I like this law because it is actually a very nice example of how laws are made in our internal market. The European Union creates a framework that gives the countries a solid database. And this basis serves as the basis for tailor -made laws on site - differently depending on the region or member country. This is how European Union goes. This is how subsidiarity goes. Please more of it! Many thanks to our rapporteur Kim van Sparrentak. Thank you for the good cooperation to all other colleagues.","- Ms. President, dear Commissioner, valued colleagues!

Today some platforms do not comply with existing obligations and states move in scattered order. The legislative void precisely in short rents is a real problem. This regulation harmonizes the registration procedures between the online platforms and the competent authorities: it is not the definitive solution, but certainly it is a first fundamental step to give the Member States the tools necessary to legislate correctly. I am proud that all our priorities have been confirmed. They will receive a registration number. Online platforms will have to make sure that the information provided by the correct and, finally, the authorities will be able to act in the event of fraudulent use of the platform activities. In short, transparency and rules to make sure that, finally, political choices can then be made in a sector in continuous growth, that of short rents.

Properly regulated, they can provide accommodation for all who need it. Short-term lettings are making our housing crisis worse by taking homes off the market and they’re driving up prices and rents. Meanwhile, the Commission is delaying the introduction of a registration system in Ireland. Enough is enough! We have to provide solutions, not barriers to progress. The short-term regulation is progress. Sharing data is the future.

Now the proper functioning of the European tourist ecosystem will be able to derive important benefits from this new regulation, thanks to a unique and simple series of information on information for the platforms and simplified registration procedures for landlords. The greatest transparency will strengthen the trust of travelers and help national and local authorities to develop better policies in the tourism sector, in order to ensure its social and environmental sustainability.","- Mrs. President, Mr. Commissioner, Ladies Fellow, the accommodation rented for short periods represent about a quarter of the total of the tourist accommodation facilities in the European Union this is a phenomenon that has been characterized by a great expansion in recent years.

The regulation will also facilitate the fight against illegally offered apartments. However, it is on the Member States themselves and cities themselves to use this regulation. It is only up to them whether they will introduce permit modes and whether they will request data from the platforms. And I firmly hope that the Czech Republic will take full advantage of this, because even the current insufficient regulation of short -term leases contributes to the fact that Prague is the most expensive city to housing throughout the European Union. There will be a chance to do something with the market for housing, so use it and stop just throwing people looking for housing, sticks under their feet unwillingness or fear of anger of platforms and speculators and preventing a chance to live well. I also firmly hope that the future European Commission will become more active in housing. The problem of unavailable housing applies to the whole of Europe and it is necessary to clearly start acting so that every person has the right to dignified housing and to be a place to live.","- Mrs. President, Dear Commissioners, especially Mrs. Newsletter, thank you very much for your work, because I think it is largely the result of your deployment that today we have a finished text I am glad that after years when the European Union housing area Ignored, we will vote tomorrow about the regulation of regulations at least what data have on-line platforms in the field of short-term leases such as Airbnb, sharing with cities is no secret that short-term lease often leads to raising housing prices and deteriorating quality of life in According to regulation, platforms will have to share detailed information about the apartments that are offered through them and will be responsible for their completeness and accuracy.

166804,"– Mr President, Commissioner Simson, dear colleagues, it has been identified by the worldwide experts that cutting methane emissions is one of the most effective ways in order to reduce near-term global warming And according to my opinion, it is a quick win to tackle the climate crisis With the methane emissions reduction in the energy sector regulation, which we will vote on tomorrow, here in this House, we strike a balance and pave the way in order, first, to improve the accuracy of information on the main sources of methane emissions associated with energy consumed in the EU, second, to ensure further effective mitigation of methane emissions across the energy supply chain in the EU, third, to reduce methane emissions related to fossil energy imported to the EU without putting at stake our security of supply, which is also important and fourth, to avoid any additional cost to the end users, the consumers, SMEs and the industry. At the same time, with our report, with Parliament’s report, we give proper time to Member States to adapt and incentives to companies to invest in methane mitigation technologies as soon as feasible. This provision is another clear message to the citizens in reducing transmission, particularly in Poland, that the EU is ready to facilitate the acceleration of the energy transition without leaving anyone behind – and this is real solidarity. In my opinion, one of the key elements of this regulation is also to provide support to companies in order to achieve performance standards in an optimal manner while fully respecting the polluter pays principle. This is key to avoid too high cost for citizens. Commissioner, dear colleagues, by regulating methane emissions to the energy sector once again, the EU is taking the lead to tackle the climate crisis. We have to stick on our word. We initiated the Global Methane Pledge in Glasgow, binding ourselves to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030 compared with the level of 2020 and also involving all the relevant sectors, starting with energy, agriculture and waste management. It is now time to put this legislation into force as soon as possible.","– Mr President, Commissioner Simson, dear colleagues, it has been identified by the worldwide experts that cutting methane emissions is one of the most effective ways in order to reduce near-term global warming And according to my opinion, it is a quick win to tackle the climate crisis With the methane emissions reduction in the energy sector regulation, which we will vote on tomorrow, here in this House, we strike a balance and pave the way in order, first, to improve the accuracy of information on the main sources of methane emissions associated with energy consumed in the EU, second, to ensure further effective mitigation of methane emissions across the energy supply chain in the EU, third, to reduce methane emissions related to fossil energy imported to the EU without putting at stake our security of supply, which is also important and fourth, to avoid any additional cost to the end users, the consumers, SMEs and the industry.

166804,"- Mr President, Dear Ms. Commissioner Simson, dear colleagues! I am happy that five factions support the proposal in the morning. I believe that this proposal deserves this; Because this broad support has become possible because this proposal reaches two things: it is an ambitious start to push back the emission of a gas with considerable potential to endanger the climate, and it has been possible not to endanger jobs and economic activities. I want to make it clear using the example of the Polish mining, as the colleague Spyraki did. There are two guardrails on which this proposal is based: the one was not to endanger the already existing plan in Poland to deploy the mining. The social security for the Polish miners and the prevention of a social break, above all in the areas in the areas in Silesia, were particularly important to my faction, the social democratic faction To set game. As part of this plan, a reduction in methane emissions from the active shaft systems there is also to be reached. Yes, I am a little proud that I was able to contribute this proposal and of course received the support of the other shadow rapporteurs and the rapporteur himself. Dear colleagues, the social democratic faction supports the proposal for the methane regulation, and we will agree with him tomorrow.","- Mr President, Dear Ms. Commissioner Simson, dear colleagues!

166804,"- Mr. President, Mrs. Commissioner, reducing methane emissions must be part of the solution of the climate crisis not only because we have committed ourselves to the methane challenge in Glasgow, but mainly because we damage our health, economy, energy security and last but not least climate Methane is 80 times worse climate gas than CO2. Today, in the production of fossil fuels used, the atmosphere is released or deliberately released a large number of methane. Routine release or leaks from neglected infrastructure are a normal thing. And the methane is actually the fossil gas that was so expensive last autumn, which we all saved, and we said how we will miss. All of this happened at a time when we were afraid of having something to heat. And actually, what is enough for us to tighten the taps, replace the valves. In order to, and in that legislation and in our comments, we have given space to innovation, gave space to new NATO technologies to be able to find out where the leaks are, detect them and repair them. Now the situation looks as if we let the water drip. And we have to stop it, because wasting is something that damages the planet, but also the wallets. The International Energy Agency, Scientists, Economists agree that we have relatively cheap tools in our hands that can prevent the average global temperature from increasing while contributing to our energy security. Methane emissions are exactly these tools. We must not forget that this problem is not only about Europe, and therefore I am glad that we are trying to influence emissions outside the European Union, which we, so to speak, import. And I believe that at the nearest climate conference we will also advance in the global tool to reduce methane emissions. Maybe we give him a price. Measures against methane leakage are both technologically and financially available. It would be a mistake not to use them.","- Mr. President, Mrs. Commissioner, reducing methane emissions must be part of the solution of the climate crisis not only because we have committed ourselves to the methane challenge in Glasgow, but mainly because we damage our health, economy, energy security and last but not least climate Methane is 80 times worse climate gas than CO2.

The greenhouse effect on the planet Earth has never increased as quickly as it does right now in recent weeks, the levels of carbon dioxide are about five million parts higher than a year since it is an increase rate that is in the order of twice as large as the one we had on average Over the past 10-20 years, the UN Climate Panel IPCC also writes very clearly in the latest report that now we also have to take power when it comes to emissions of methane methane is a much more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide is, especially on the short time scale, On the time scale that we have to make this whole change. This text that we will vote for tomorrow shows that we in Parliament can be much, much more ambitious than the Commission and the Member States have shown. We also know where the money is to be taken from, namely from the fossil industry. It would be enough to take 3 percent of their profits from the past year to get away from 80 percent in that sector. That's exactly what we have to make sure to do now.","- Mr. President!

Tomorrow we are voting over the regulation on the reduction of methane emissions, remember that the weight of this problem goes far beyond the framework of the EU climate policy for Upper Silesia, where I come from, which is also a litmus paper of the success of European green order, it is also a fundamental issue for economic and social reasons. That is why I thank the reporters and counterparts for a constructive dialogue. They were sometimes very difficult conversations, but also specific and substantive, stained not only for climate, but also about people and workplaces in mines. I am glad that we were able to find a compromise that we have already talked about here today, which gives more breath above all to Polish mines. I want to ask you to vote for accepting this text. Let's vote wisely, responsibly, in the spirit of EU Solidarity.","- Mr. Chairman!

While the invoices of our companies explode, the administrative constraints are always heavier and competition from third countries is more stifling than ever. In this text, you offer aberrant measures, it must be said. You want imports of essential materials, such as coal, gas, oil, to be affected by new legislation. Instead of helping European industry, you add new administrative constraints and new charges to sectors that are on the front line to ensure our energy autonomy. So, remember, our companies are by far the most virtuous in the world. Let us remind Europeans that before being polluting industries, they are indeed actors essential to the survival of our continent. Here is what is missing your text: more support and fewer constraints, much fewer constraints. Our strategic industries are at the end.

However, the text is disappointing in relation to coal: yet again, in behind closed doors negotiations, EPP propped up the far right. Yet again, EPP repeatedly parroted word for word the talking points of the fossil fuel industry and the lobbyists.

This is the case for the integrity authority set up by the Hungarian government to meet the commission's requests. This authority does not have the powers of carrying out its anti -corruption missions. The Commission must therefore pay very attention to the expenses it imposes on Hungary in the domain of the rule of law. It is absolutely not enough to demand that means be put in place. It is not enough to require measures, require results. And it is the results that Hungary must be measured, also in the case of the integrity authority. Also, apart from all the laws of law already existing, among other things of corruption and independence of justice, is added today the creation of a defense authority of sovereignty, which allows The Hungarian state to use a law called ""foreign anti-influence"" to in fact gag any opposition to the government. This is the typical case of diversion of a law at the start of European inspiration, but used in ""Russian"" fashion which, instead of protecting citizens and democracy, is transformed into an intimidation law to prevent the Civil society, journalists and politicians to express their opposition to power. The Commission has also justly launched a procedure against Hungary following the implementation of this law. Finally, I would like to note that the Council did not play its role in what looks at the article seven and also raised once again the difficult situation in which the European Union will be at the time when Hungary will assume the presidency of the Union on July 1ᵉʳ, at a crucial time for the European Union, the day after the elections and at the time of the constitution of a new commission. In this Parliament, we had asked the council to take responsibility and to consider postponing this Hungarian presidency to a later time. It was not done. The 26 must now be particularly vigilant.","- Mr. President, the Commissioner, Hungary is once again in the plenary of the Parliament Yes, once again in the plenary of Parliament unfortunately, this is the whole problem the Hungarian government does not accept to see its offenses at the 'PROGRAM, does not accept union criticisms and does not want to amend the measures taken are manifestly simply to throw powder in the eyes, so they are not effective and do not produce the expected effects .

168054,"- Mr. President, Madam Commissioner, Dear colleagues, the right to a safe and legal abortion is a necessity and a question of public health while we build Europe of health here, in this parliament, this parliament of which Simone Veil was the president, while we legislate to allow all European citizens an equal access to care, a woman dies every nine minutes of a clandestine abortion, however, you must have a speech of truth and stop deceiving citizens . Emmanuel Macron promises to include the right to abortion in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and thus wishes to position himself as the great defender of women's rights in Europe. The registration of the right to abortion in the charter is certainly a great intention, to which I fully subscribe, but what Emmanuel Macron does not say is that it is, today, technically impossible. Impossible, because it is not a European competence. Impossible, because the charter of fundamental rights having the value of a treaty, it is necessary, to modify, the unanimity of the governments of the Member States. And, contrary to what you are suggested, to register the right to abortion in the Charter, it is not enough for a simple majority vote in the European Parliament, all the governments of the 27 Member States must Unanimously agree. In other words, the refusal of a single state makes this inscription in the charter impossible. However, as we know, many states still slow down four irons on this issue. I think of Malta, Poland, Hungary. Mr. Macron, the European electoral campaign should not make our Parliament a theater where a comedy of Europe is played out. Let us not ment to citizens on what can really be done at European level. Let's be honest. The action of the European Union has its limits, those imposed by the treaties. Let's be frank. If Emmanuel Macron had really wanted to defend the rights of women, he would not have vetoed the inclusion of rape in the very first European law to combat violence against women. And, in this regard, his latest statements are unlikely and irresponsible. And then let's be transparent. The right to abortion? Yes. But what about when, in our own territory, in France, support structures and doctors are lacking, when women cannot have access to care, required care services? Are it not the urgency and priority of Mr. Macron? You have to stop making a diversion. A few weeks before the European elections, women deserve much better than that.","- Mr. President, Madam Commissioner, Dear colleagues, the right to a safe and legal abortion is a necessity and a question of public health while we build Europe of health here, in this parliament, this parliament of which Simone Veil was the president, while we legislate to allow all European citizens an equal access to care, a woman dies every nine minutes of a clandestine abortion, however, you must have a speech of truth and stop deceiving citizens . Emmanuel Macron promises to include the right to abortion in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and thus wishes to position himself as the great defender of women's rights in Europe. The registration of the right to abortion in the charter is certainly a great intention, to which I fully subscribe, but what Emmanuel Macron does not say is that it is, today, technically impossible. Impossible, because it is not a European competence. Impossible, because the charter of fundamental rights having the value of a treaty, it is necessary, to modify, the unanimity of the governments of the Member States. And, contrary to what you are suggested, to register the right to abortion in the Charter, it is not enough for a simple majority vote in the European Parliament, all the governments of the 27 Member States must Unanimously agree. In other words, the refusal of a single state makes this inscription in the charter impossible. However, as we know, many states still slow down four irons on this issue. I think of Malta, Poland, Hungary. Mr. Macron, the European electoral campaign should not make our Parliament a theater where a comedy of Europe is played out. Let us not ment to citizens on what can really be done at European level. Let's be honest. The action of the European Union has its limits, those imposed by the treaties. Let's be frank. If Emmanuel Macron had really wanted to defend the rights of women, he would not have vetoed the inclusion of rape in the very first European law to combat violence against women.

168054,"– Mr President, it is time for feminists, for progressives and for citizens to ask for what is needed And in 2024, enshrining sexual and reproductive rights in the heart of our European text is a necessity for the well-being of people and specifically the safety of women There is no healthy democracy without women’s rights and gender equality Last November, this Parliament voted to have the inclusion of these rights in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and it is good to reaffirm it today But why be less ambitious? We have to reclaim the entirety of our rights and to counter the narrative of the far right and those who want to make us live in fear. Bodily autonomy comes with contraception. Bodily autonomy comes with sexual education. The health of women can no longer be less of a priority for academics and doctors. Ignorance has always been a poison used to control a population. Of course we need abortion. Abortion gives women the power to choose their own lives. This is not a discussion. There are still too many women at risk of dying, or having to flee their country to find a solution, or seeing their life dramatically impacted by an unwanted pregnancy in the European Union. Yes! But this is a societal and democratic issue, not a woman’s problem. All people, no matter what their sex and gender, should know their body. So this is how to protect it. How to heal it. The nature of desire. What is consent? This is what we need. We need full and universal access to sexual and reproductive health and rights without discrimination, including, indeed, access to safe and legal abortion.","– Mr President, it is time for feminists, for progressives and for citizens to ask for what is needed And in 2024, enshrining sexual and reproductive rights in the heart of our European text is a necessity for the well-being of people and specifically the safety of women There is no healthy democracy without women’s rights and gender equality Last November, this Parliament voted to have the inclusion of these rights in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and it is good to reaffirm it today But why be less ambitious?

Unfortunately, the previous guideline for the fight against human trafficking from 2001 has not changed anything. Why? For two simple, but all the more frustrating reasons: First: So far, it has not been implemented or only insufficiently implemented by the majority of Member States. Secondly, the crime area, not least through the Internet, has developed decisively. The new version therefore focuses precisely on giving criminal investigation and law enforcement authorities more instruments in order to take a look Knowingly from victims, to improve, to counter the cynical possibilities of the online dimension more consistently and to improve the proceedings for early identification and support of the victims.

The update of this directive takes more measures to protect victims by introducing early detection and specialised assistance. It also provides for more opportunities to persecute perpetrators by introducing measures for legal persons, aggravating circumstances and punishment for those who knowingly use services from trafficked persons. Trafficking is not only the crime, it is a blatant violation of human rights.","– Madam President, in January, when we were already heavily negotiating on the directive, an article was published in the local Brussels newspaper It was the story of Ernestine, an undocumented migrant who left her home country to flee from domestic violence Ernestine was offered a place to stay in exchange for childcare without any proper pay In fact, her so-called employer started demanding that Ernestine contribute to bills and rent When she reached out to help, she was recruited to work at a vegetable shop for EUR 2 per hour Her employer would demand rent money from her because he let her sleep in the corner of the shop, that way he kept her indebted This is not far away from home, this is in Brussels Ernestine and many vulnerable persons are being recruited in order to be exploited and tricked into cheap labour.

Parliament is expected to give its consent for the Council decision on the withdrawal and the EPP is supportive of the withdrawal decision of the Council.

During this mandate, our European Parliament adopted this ambition by majority, pushing several Member States to make this choice. Rightly and under our pressure, they came out individually from this obsolete treaty. We cannot accept that one of our Member States is attacked by foreign powers or entities that place their economic interests before our objectives of independence and carbon neutrality. With the new affirmation of this vote, we must finally concretize the coordinated exit of the European Union of the Treaty on the Charter of Energy. Thus, we will definitively pass from speech to acts, speeches to the concrete defense of our European ambitions and interests.

168589,"- The Mr President, the fact that we now decide to resign as a European Union, tells how far we have come in climate action This agreement has been the only things that fossil companies have left when they have been desperately trying to slow down European transformation towards carbon neutral and clean energy. In recent years, we have launched hundreds of billion, if not thousands of billions of euros, to invest in pure energy and clean green. It can be said that, according to the International Energy Organization, the green transition from Europe has created thirty percent of Europe's growth in recent years, compared with 10 % of economic growth in global green growth. So this is the thing we have progressed and the fact that we now resign from this fossil protective charter is an important step in our work that the Europe and the European Union is the first to completely get rid of fossil energy, and this is also a message about accelerating investment in clean solutions.","- The Mr President, the fact that we now decide to resign as a European Union, tells how far we have come in climate action This agreement has been the only things that fossil companies have left when they have been desperately trying to slow down European transformation towards carbon neutral and clean energy.

168589,"- Mrs. President! Millions of people in Europe already feel the effects of energy policy of millions of Europeans from their own pocket pay for the dreams of Eurocrats from 2026. Each of us will be affected by the increase in electricity prices, our continent will stop developing, and Europe remains behind China and the United States. The green madness imposed on the Member States, unfortunately, by the European Commission. Green order is choked on our economy. Investments in solar panels, heat pumps or windmills are 90% shipping money to China, because their companies are leading in these technologies. Not only that, when we destroy our coal industry and close the mines, a new coal block is created in Asia every week. Green order will lead to poverty and unemployment. Instead of developing our companies, we will become assemblies for Chinese producers. Instead of focusing on raw materials available in Europe, we become addicted to Chinese supplies. And how much it hurts, Pandemia showed. Time to change the direction. It's time to restore Europe to its inhabitants. Time to stop green order and enjoy economic sovereignty, wealth and development. We want to live and breathe clean air. We want to live in a friendly environment, but all this must be and take place in accordance with the rules, slowly and not at the expense, and not forced to the inhabitants of Europe.","- Mrs. President!

168589,"- Madam President, France has chosen to withdraw from the Treaty on the Energy Charter The Member States did the same collectively a month ago we will therefore vote in favor of an exit from the Union European decided by the sovereign choice of states, however, unlike the major statements that we mean here, the withdrawal of the Treaty on the Charter of Energy is neither an ideological advance nor an assurance of the success of our energy policy. There is no feat to vote for the exit of a treaty abandoned by all. There are just a few governments which, like that of Emmanuel Macron, excuse the failure of their energy policy by incriminating a treaty that would come to an end. Yes, Madame Vedrenne, you smile, but you know it's reality. It is easy to denounce only the Treaty on the Energy Charter not to tell the European peoples that the European Union does not hold its promises in energy matters. As you know, the best way to convert our energy model is to massively support investments in the nuclear field. There is no other way to hope to achieve our climatic goals. However, for five years, the national rally had to fight on all texts in order to defend French nuclear, on the financing of hydrogen as on direct aid of states for our power stations. We were the first to encourage low carbon hydrogen, the one that France can produce with a decisive comparative advantage. Unfortunately, the European Union is still reluctant to make it the major asset in the development of the sector of our continent. The French are always deprived of access to inexpensive electricity, due to the absurd rules of the European electricity market. Our country is condemned to undergo variations in gas prices, rather than being able to freely benefit from the production of its nuclear power plants. Once again, the European Union of Macron and Von Der Leyen presented the interests of the European Union on those of our compatriots. The decreasing ideology, which takes the place of an energy compass to the Commission, condemns us to economic and industrial downgrading. Quickly, let us reform this European Union to become that of nuclear growth and support.","- Madam President, France has chosen to withdraw from the Treaty on the Energy Charter The Member States did the same collectively a month ago we will therefore vote in favor of an exit from the Union European decided by the sovereign choice of states, however, unlike the major statements that we mean here, the withdrawal of the Treaty on the Charter of Energy is neither an ideological advance nor an assurance of the success of our energy policy.

164493,"- Mr. President, honorable colleagues, the discipline we are facing, the sensitive discipline relating to the circulation and use of waste impacts on one of the most captivating topics of the debate on the future of sustainability, especially from an economic and industrial point of view in Europe we We have to - and in this discipline we are succeeding - we must encourage the free movement of waste in such a way that those who are able to recover and recycle them in a sustainable way are in the condition to do so. However, there is a very relevant industrial data on which we allowed ourselves to formulate some amendments. Most of the refusal exported by the European Union is refusal of a ferrous nature, therefore it is raw material for the creation of green steel. This is the crucial point on which we allowed ourselves to report that the export of this raw material, rather than this refusal, could favor countries that, treating them in a much less sustainable way than what does not happen in Europe, then carry out steel that comes Then sold in Europe at very low prices, having been made not respecting the environmental rules that we respect. It is very important that, on the specific issue, not so much to create a distinct discipline, but because about 60% of the exported waste is exactly of this nature, it is very important that there is particular attention on this issue, not to reduce freedom of circulation of refusal or raw material, but to encourage the best European sustainable industry, in particular in the steel sector.","- Mr. President, honorable colleagues, the discipline we are facing, the sensitive discipline relating to the circulation and use of waste impacts on one of the most captivating topics of the debate on the future of sustainability, especially from an economic and industrial point of view in Europe we We have to - and in this discipline we are succeeding - we must encourage the free movement of waste in such a way that those who are able to recover and recycle them in a sustainable way are in the condition to do so.

So, why we live in one world and pollution in one side of the world affects everyone. So, because we care about the health and rights of those living in developing countries; And so, because every piece of waste in the European Union we have to look at it as a resource. Everything is used and the circular economy we talk about and create about it can only become a reality if we stop once and for all the landfills we are creating around the world in the most helpful countries and not garbage. Mr President, it was a pleasure for me to negotiate this law, along with Pernille and my fellow, to achieve the best and best for our environment and to the health of all citizens, even those who They live away from it. And allow me to boast of the three biggest achievements we will be doing if it is given the confidence for the work we have done over the past year. First of all, we will stop once and for all the export of plastic waste outside the European Union. Mr Commissioner, this is a toxic waste. It is leading to changing natural habitats, affecting biodiversity, reducing the ability for ecosystems to adapt to climate change and have a negative impact on food production and social justice. When I proposed this step, I found a lot of resistance. But today we have an absolute majority of political groups in this room that agree with me and say so much for plastic. Secondly, any other waste emanating outside the European Union should only go to plants that have the same European standards. We can never accept that what is done in our home, that we do not accept what is done in our home, we should not accept it anywhere else around the world. And finally, we are reducing bureaucracy within the European Union so that waste can be moved from one country to another in the European Union. And so, I urge you tomorrow to join us by voting for the environment, our health and the environmental economy.","-Mr President, if there is a thing that we all know to do, it is to keep our homes clean and then come and wake up from what is happening outside our door and to date it is also the A European waste policy but now we will say so much.

164493,"- Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, A little word to start to thank our rapporteur, Ms. Weiss, for this spirit of openness, this spirit of compromise which made it possible to achieve a collective result of which we can be proud we have targeted The ambition, with this major reform of European waste transfer rules: better protecting the environment and health, preventing certain countries from remaining the trash of the globe. And the challenge is size: in 2020, our waste exports to third countries exceeded 32 million tonnes. It’s hardly imaginable. We have added several stones to the building of the legislative text which was proposed to us by the Commission in November 2021, starting with what is one of my main political battles: the elimination of plastic pollution on the planet. The end of the export of plastic waste to third countries will be a reality three years after the entry into force of this regulation, four years for the OECD countries. The fight against plastic pollution, which take between a hundred years and a thousand years to deteriorate and which kill our oceans, is global: it must become total. There are obviously other advances in our text: I think of the pure and simple ban to export hazardous waste to third countries (China, India, certain countries of the African continent) or to this request pressing the commission of increased monitoring of exported waste to OECD countries (the United States, Japan, Israel, Turkey, especially). I conclude on the paradigm change which is taking place - and for the best - in the European Union. Faced with the closure by China of its recycling market two years ago now, which led to a real upheaval in the world market, also faced with the exhaustion of natural resources, Europe understood that it should take its Destiny in hand and protect its domestic market. As for waste, this means to harden export conditions - what we do - and better value them with us, so that this waste becomes a usable and durable resource. It will also be all benefit for many sectors of the industry.","- Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, A little word to start to thank our rapporteur, Ms. Weiss, for this spirit of openness, this spirit of compromise which made it possible to achieve a collective result of which we can be proud we have targeted The ambition, with this major reform of European waste transfer rules: better protecting the environment and health, preventing certain countries from remaining the trash of the globe.

164493,"- Chairman, dear colleagues, Europe is dumping millions of tons of plastic waste in countries outside the EU that cannot handle that at all. Whether it is burned and where it is processed, then that is often in very dangerous working conditions, and often with child labor that is completely unacceptable if we burn that plastic waste or put it underground, then we ensure air pollution, for soil contamination , for the emission of hazardous substances. This huge waste problem is our responsibility. Belgium is in the top ten of the exporters of plastic waste. That is why I was very happy that the committee proposed to tackle the dumping of waste and that illegal exports. We have tightened this proposal on crucial points with the parliament. I am very happy with the cooperation across the various groups, and glad we were able to convince them, especially from the following: an export ban for all the plastic waste outside the EU, because: 1) This is the best solution for our plastic problem , 2) We finally take our historical responsibility, and 3) It is really a stimulus to start using less plastic, to better design it and also to sharpen our recycling capacity. I believe 100% that our industry can handle this and that it can be an advantage for our circular economy. I am also pleased that all waste processing installations outside the EU must now meet the same high standards as the European - also something that was originally not in the proposal. It is time for us to clean up our own mess. So vote for a ban on the export of waste outside the EU and for stricter regulations on waste transports.","- Chairman, dear colleagues, Europe is dumping millions of tons of plastic waste in countries outside the EU that cannot handle that at all.

The waste trade market represents more than 80 billion euros, for 182 million tonnes exchanged worldwide. Waste which, for the most part, is sent to poor or developing countries, where recycling conditions are not guaranteed, where workers' rights are flouted, where traffickers and operators of all kinds swarm. This waste often ends up buried or rejected in the sea, accentuating the pollution of our oceans a little more. Their routing is done by container carrier, responsible for a large part of greenhouse gas emissions. This is the reality of waste transfers and a world without any borders to the absurd. Because yes, it is absurd to find bricks of French milk at the other end of the world, German batteries or used Spanish boxes, when you advocate a virtuous ecology. The free trade and the free movement of goods without hindrance or reflection came up against their gigantic trash can, and that is a good thing. At the foot of the wall, let us therefore organize the relocation of a fundamental activity for our future: recycling. In that it restricts exports, this text takes note of the need to put a brake on globalization, strengthen our European industries and promote the circular economy and short circuits, which we have always defended against you. Let us hope that the European Union becomes aware of the urgency of these relocations to respond to the industrial and climatic emergency that we undergo.","- Mr. President, this text symbolically acts the end of supposedly happy globalization, but which in reality has only compartmentalized the world in areas: industrial production zones, consumption zones, service zones and trash zones Asia , legitimately asking for more respect and respect, returned European and American waste, then imposing to review our economic and ecological model to say the least wobbly and unjust.

It is the liberalization of this market that moves and where the proposal focuses, ignoring the limits and ineffectiveness of private waste management, but highly effective in the maximization of profits. It is profit and not the real needs, also from the environmental point of view, which determines that a significant part of the waste is directly transferred to landfill, with low multimaterial appreciation, without privileging reuse or recycling. Paradigm that can only be changed with adequate regulation and reinforcing the public dimension in waste management. One last note: We talk about the end of the line, but not the way. The accountability of companies in choosing materials, increasing product durability, combating programmed obsolescence, non -transfer of costs to populations of this market and profits that they want to ensure some. Concerns, not by chance, absent from this proposal.","- Mr. President, let's be clear, this discussion occurs less to safeguard the interests of peoples and the environment, but to safeguard the interests of some, few, who see in the trash business a way to fill their pockets a market with tens of Thousands of millions of euros that so -called green policies of the European Union privilege and seek to expand: restrict exports to what has less economic potential; Maintain profit accumulation in the domestic market; growing conditionalities and interference with third countries; Remove competences from states, interfering with waste management depending on their interests, centralizing them in the European Commission.

Consumers should have easier to make informed decisions in their everyday purchases to make flat -rate claims that products or services are sustainable, climate -neutral or climate -apititive, so that in the future it will be a new procedure for environmental statements, but in view of the inflationary and Often non -transparent use of such products on all possible products - from furniture to toothbrushes to air travel - this is also necessary to keep the competition in Europe fair and transparent: If you absolutely want to advertise your products as climate -neutral or climate -ap. Just check it beforehand. As a European People's Party, we have enforced an unbureaucratic procedure so that the administrative effort becomes easy. Because why should stricter rules apply to simple advertising statements, Mr. Commissioner, for example for product safety? That would create more bureaucracy that does not even help the environment. That is why we campaigned for a procedure with presumption of conformity according to the example of the regulation on general product safety; This is a way that also helps the smaller and medium -sized companies. In this respect, I hope that the text will be accepted in this way.","- President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues!

166226,"- Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, ""Ecological"", ""Green"", ""Sustainable"" or ""T -shirt made with recycled plastic bottles"" are some of the many allegations that have become fashionable and that we find more and more when we make a purchase of clothing, washing machines or even a plane ticket in the fight against climate change, consumers want to contribute our grain of sand and therefore we opt for products respectful of the environment. On the side of the merchants we find many who also want to do things well and contribute to this transition making their most sustainable products. However, there are also those who want to take advantage of the fact that ""green sells"" with false claims. Because we are faced with a pandemic called ecoblanqueo or, since in Europe we know that more than 50% of ecological allegations give vague, misleading or unfounded information. Therefore, as a socialist alternative rapporteur for this directive proposal, I have worked with the other groups to eradicate our shelves through more transparency and more verification in three aspects: first of all, forcing companies to certify before a Independent and accredited verifier all its allegations, also in the online markets; secondly, empowering consumers with information and transparency in products they buy to make conscious and responsible decisions; And, thirdly, establishing sanctions for the first time for those companies that fail to comply with the rules or cheat so that they do not slip it with their false allegations. We want to protect the environment and those companies that do things well. With this legislation, Europe is provided with tools necessary to combat those who want to use, with lies and falsehoods, to a responsible citizenship that claims that we all act with the environment. I want to thank Commissioner Breton the initiative to put this directive proposal on the table, and also thank all the negotiators because we have reached a good agreement. We must protect the environment and protect consumers, because we play our future. And, ladies, the police have finally arrived.","- Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, ""Ecological"", ""Green"", ""Sustainable"" or ""T -shirt made with recycled plastic bottles"" are some of the many allegations that have become fashionable and that we find more and more when we make a purchase of clothing, washing machines or even a plane ticket in the fight against climate change, consumers want to contribute our grain of sand and therefore we opt for products respectful of the environment. On the side of the merchants we find many who also want to do things well and contribute to this transition making their most sustainable products. However, there are also those who want to take advantage of the fact that ""green sells"" with false claims. Because we are faced with a pandemic called ecoblanqueo or, since in Europe we know that more than 50% of ecological allegations give vague, misleading or unfounded information. Therefore, as a socialist alternative rapporteur for this directive proposal, I have worked with the other groups to eradicate our shelves through more transparency and more verification in three aspects: first of all, forcing companies to certify before a [PARTY] and accredited verifier all its allegations, also in the online markets; secondly, empowering consumers with information and transparency in products they buy to make conscious and responsible decisions; And, thirdly, establishing sanctions for the first time for those companies that fail to comply with the rules or cheat so that they do not slip it with their false allegations. We want to protect the environment and those companies that do things well. With this legislation, Europe is provided with tools necessary to combat those who want to use, with lies and falsehoods, to a responsible citizenship that claims that we all act with the environment. I want to thank Commissioner Breton the initiative to put this directive proposal on the table, and also thank all the negotiators because we have reached a good agreement. We must protect the environment and protect consumers, because we play our future. And, ladies, the police have finally arrived."

Eco -friendly sustainable 50 percent less emissions Green climate -compensated reduced climate impact Low emission levels Best in the Circular environmental benefits class in the future -proof fossil -free climate hero and climate neutral! Yes, dear child has many names. Many promise, but few deliver. More than half of all claims made are straightforward, misleading, misleading or even lies. So we can't have it. This law will fight ""greenwashing"" and create simple conditions for companies to contribute to the transition. It should ensure that you do not need to be a chemical expert to understand what you are buying. It is the Center Party's message to everyone at home. You should be able to rely on environmental claims. When we say green, then we mean green. And once again - hard work in the EU gives results when governments at home fail the climate.","- Mr. President!

166226,"– Mr President, plastic-free, no palm oil, free from recycled plastic, carbon neutral – walking around in a supermarket, you could easily think that most products are sustainable already And that is why 61 % of consumers find it difficult to know which products are the best for the environment And their intuition is correct, because 50 % of green claims are vague or misleading Companies are abusing the willingness of consumers to make the right choice for the planet and are constantly lying to us. But – maybe this is a wakeup call for some – Amazon and Shell, they are not climate champions and this greenwashing needs to stop. Greenwashing is not only bad for the consumer, but also for those companies that are truly sustainable and that, in the end, is also bad for the planet. And for everyone who claims this is complicated for businesses, it is not. It’s very simple. Companies that want to make a green claim will need to prove, based on scientific evidence, that what they claim is true and have it verified by external experts. It’s a shame that political groups are trying to undermine this text, and even ones who use it to legalise greenwashing practices by scrapping the entire article on penalties and by allowing highly polluting industries to remain silent on their overall environmental impact. I call on everyone to support our consumers, support the green transition and vote against greenwashing tomorrow.","– Mr President, plastic-free, no palm oil, free from recycled plastic, carbon neutral – walking around in a supermarket, you could easily think that most products are sustainable already And that is why 61 % of consumers find it difficult to know which products are the best for the environment And their intuition is correct, because 50 % of green claims are vague or misleading Companies are abusing the willingness of consumers to make the right choice for the planet and are constantly lying to us.

166226,"- Mr. Chairman! Ladies and Gentlemen, I am satisfied with an initiative, the purpose of which is to promote the economy with a more closed circulation and fight the ecoście, but there are specific aspects of the proposed directive, which in my opinion was not supported by a meaningful analysis in particular, I would like to emphasize my fears about the lack of clarity in definitions and principles regarding environmental declarations, undefined guidelines can lead to consumer confusion and difficulties for enterprises in conducting business in accordance with the provisions, if we want the law we adopt to be observed, we must ensure that it is clear and understandable. What's more, the current provisions should be fully applied to avoid applying or creating dead law. For example, restrictions imposed on ecological claims in highly polluting industries, for which there is still no clear definition, can lead to interpretative chaos and stop the modernization of these enterprises. Therefore, reflection requires detail of the conditions for the use of penalties. Market supervision authorities in the Member States should have adequate freedom in this respect. What is crucial, the medicine for the ecoście cannot be worse than the disease itself. We cannot allow the certification process of sustainable norms by excessive bureaucracy and expensive procedures. Consumers, but also European business cannot afford the experiments of green order, which are completely detached from reality. However, I believe that further work on this report during negotiations with the Council may lead to more life solutions. And we all should depend on this in this room.","- Mr. Chairman!

How do you want to bring more environmentally friendly consumption and our fellow citizens without access to transparent and respectful information of the consumer? The answer partly goes through compliance with strict environmental standards for businesses, environmental standards which, for example, no longer allow Philip Morris to bait the consumer with disposable electronic cigarettes supposedly respectful of the environment. Because, in addition to the lie relating to the lack of respect for public health, this constitutes a deception in the legal sense. Stop too many products that make their marketing on the back of the environment, without real scientific foundation, and for simple marketing reasons! I therefore invite you, dear colleagues, to vote for this text tomorrow so that companies no longer have their hands completely free to afford to put green where, sometimes, there is only profit.","- Mr. President, the Commissioner, dear colleagues, throughout the 20th century and until today, our industrial system has induced an important exploitation of the resources offered by nature - we cannot deny that it is the Ephemeral mode, products from the food industry or the tobacco industry, these sectors have, like all the products processed by humans, a harmful impact on the environment then, in view of this emergency, it will not have escaped you that these practices today arouse a drastic change in our production methods, but also of consumption.

163150,"- Mrs. President, Dear Commissioner, dear colleagues! For me, parliamentarianism is one of the great innovations of mankind why? Because this is a political form of coexistence that also defends fundamental rights and fundamental rights are part of what the European Union is now nowhere in the world human dignity and freedom rights are kept up so far from this. Defending new ones what generations have built up here. Parliamentarianism etches out what violence in the world was previously where decisions were made by force - the violence of an authority was the violence of the street. Parliamentarianism at least tries to overcome this, and the fundamental rights try to fix it. Each generation had to defend fundamental rights in its own way. And we have to see: what do we have to do today? What is to do in our generation to defend fundamental rights? I think a new prohibition, a prohibition policy, is a danger to fundamental rights. Appeasement - appeasement - towards aggressors in this world is a danger to fundamental rights because they are also threatened from the outside, but also a kind of Biedermeiermentality or cocooning, as former German President Christian Wulff recently said - Large majority of the people who want to live together in peace and respect who understand that freedom is primarily to respect and defend and defend the freedom of others who respect. All of this connected with corruption and other forms of crimes that go so deep that they endanger trust within our society: these are all phenomena that endanger fundamental rights today and that by defending fundamental rights in every policy area and on everyone Plain and ultimately also have to be defended and held up by the help of every citizen.","- Mrs. President, Dear Commissioner, dear colleagues!

From one of them we will deal with this same plenary: the need for a security plan of journalists, in the face of intimidation, and also, of course, of guarantee of informative pluralism. And the second is very important because it has had a presence throughout the entire debate that has led to the agreement on the new pact on migration and asylum ended in December: the protection of the human rights of migrants and asylum plaintiffs. Because the Charter of the Fundamental Rights of the European Union protects not only European citizens, but also any foreign, migrant or asylum plaintiff under the application of European law, which guarantees their protection against arbitrary detentions, in front of the violation of their rights, legal assistance, health care and, of course, in rescue and rescue operations in the sea, which must be respectful of human rights, a coordinated mechanism. In 2023, 40,000 people arrived in the Canary Islands, but 6,000 lost their lives in the attempt to reach the European Union. They deserve something more and better migrants and asylum plaintiffs of the European Union, as well as an absolute respect for their fundamental rights and human rights.","- Mrs. President, Mr. Commissioner Reynders, since we launched in this legislature the cycle of fundamental rights, the debate in this European Parliament of the resolution on its situation in the European Union is a classic - a point of the annual report 2022 and 2023: [NAME] - of the many points you have referred to I stay with two.

And most importantly, we created a new European authority to ensure tight and demanding supervision throughout the Union, in particular for large institutions. Fighting dirty money is a matter of justice, but also of respect for the millions of people who comply with the law and get their income honestly. There are those who speak and there are those who do. For a parliamentarian, the world will not change for the better, we will not leave any kind of brand only with inflamed speeches, but also with cabinet work, with detail work, with great will, with a lot of collaboration, through the House. This is why, with a huge taste, in my last intervention in this parliament in this legislature, that I - which I also made my share of inflamed discourses on very important topics for Europe, I believe - I also leave this testimony of a concrete work , of a concrete result, made in collaboration with my colleagues - whom I thank - of several parliamentary benches, as well as legacy of all of us, in this legislature, in these last sessions of voting, the creation of the European authority against washing of money. It is also a satisfaction, Mr. President, to make this last speech of mine while presiding over this session. Delegation colleagues, colleagues even from the Economic Committee, friends of many years ago, Mrs. Commissioner - also our colleague at the ECON Commission at the beginning of this term - this is therefore a good way to finish this mandate.

And most importantly, we created a new European authority to ensure tight and demanding supervision throughout the Union, in particular for large institutions. Fighting dirty money is a matter of justice, but also of respect for the millions of people who comply with the law and get their income honestly. There are those who speak and there are those who do. For a parliamentarian, the world will not change for the better, we will not leave any kind of brand only with inflamed speeches, but also with cabinet work, with detail work, with great will, with a lot of collaboration, through the House. This is why, with a huge taste, in my last intervention in this parliament in this legislature, that I - which I also made my share of inflamed discourses on very important topics for Europe, I believe - I also leave this testimony of a concrete work , of a concrete result, made in collaboration with my colleagues - whom I thank - of several parliamentary benches, as well as legacy of all of us, in this legislature, in these last sessions of voting, the creation of the European authority against washing of money. It is also a satisfaction, Mr. President, to make this last speech of mine while presiding over this session. Delegation colleagues, colleagues even from the Economic Committee, friends of many years ago, Mrs. Commissioner - also our colleague at the ECON Commission at the beginning of this term - this is therefore a good way to finish this mandate. Yes, we worked, we did our proclamation, but we handed over results to Europeans. And as I said, well, the Mada Commissioner a short time ago, it is good for Europeans to know that here are surrender concrete results that change our lives for the better."

No matter whether about player consultants, sponsorship or ticket sales, there are always investigations in the area of ​​football clubs, and professional sports is one of the hotspots for money laundering, roughly with Bayern, where at least one Russian oligarch has been more often in recent years Financial criminals are not far everywhere, wherever millions are juggled, and the financial damage alone is very large for the European Union with over 250 billion euros. But not only the financial damage, but also the damage to our democracy is extremely important for financial crime. We are now putting the craft with the anti-money laundering package. The money laundering package formulates clear rules, first of all binding for football clubs, but also for luxury yachts or for extremely expensive jewelry or, for example, for cryptocurrencies. We take important steps. And we will create an authority that will be responsible for coordination in the fight against money laundering in the future.

They are imprecise and de facto prohibit the advertising of everyday products, but also those needed for energy transformation, for example solar panels.

It is a text that registers, it was said by Commissioner Reynders, in a pack of texts with ""Green Claims"", with eco-design, with the right to repair and therefore there, we have a Admiral ship of this European strategy for a more sustainable market, to get out of this consumption company, to get out of this waste which was so far the rule and therefore we start to influence things we must thank the rapporteur, Mrs. Borzan, Who helped produce this text comes from afar. My colleague Pascal Durand, in the previous mandate, had made a text on the extension of the lifespan of the products. I had been rapporteur for an initiative report where it had been very difficult, including here, to gain on the ban on premature obsolescence but we had succeeded, to put the compulsory display and we had succeeded. And thanks to you, Madame Borzan, it is now in the text that will be a force of law and it is a real victory for another vision of the market than that of consumption at all costs. And then it was underlined and it is very important, we managed to talk about the question of advertising with green allegations, with this jungle, as you said, labels which are there to mislead consumers And consumers, and have them consume products that are actually bad for their economic interest, bad for ecology, but that they are presented as being positive. This kind of pressure on consumption that advertising is, it was time for it to be talked about in a legislative text. Finally, I would like to say that what I particularly like about this text is that we finally reversed the burden of responsibility. Too often, it is explained that it is consumers to make efforts, that it is they that must be empowered. No, those that must be empowered are companies. It's up to them to comply with the environmental needs that are ours and to change models. Consumers must be helped in this. Thank you for this text, thank you for this work. We must continue.","- Mr. President, hello everyone listen, well done, mission accomplished!

163059,"- Mr. Chairman! In recent years, pseudo -ecological marketing has become a serious problem that can increase in the name of the European Union forced green order What is in practice to strengthen the position of consumers in this directive? First of all, providing clear and reliable information about products, and thus the possibility of making a better choice when purchasing them is the end of paying premium price for products that use labels or statements such as ""environmentally friendly"", ""neutral for climate"" or "" Ecological ""during negotiations, we insisted on increasing the visibility of warranty information, because more than half of European consumers do not realize that all goods are covered by at least a two -year legal guarantee in the European Union. It will change now. The reminder will be present in every store, and in some cases also on packaging. We also introduce a voluntary and free guarantee of product durability, which will simplify a legal guarantee. I believe that our work will end with pseudo -ecological marketing once and for all and create a solid legal framework that protects consumers against it on the single market. This is what we all mean.","- Mr. Chairman!

163059,"- HR chairman! Fire taxation and bureaucracy It is obviously the answer if you ask this house, the European Parliament, how we solve the challenge of green transition but you forget that every time the EU comes with a new bureaucratic system, and will Have it rolled out on the companies in all EU countries, then there is only one place that the bill can end, and it is with consumers and you should have thought that you had learned it after the inflation crisis in Europe has taken complete overhaul man Haven't been able to find out how to control its economy in the same way as other Western countries in the world, the answer is again from here: Let's put more burdens on business let's propose new taxes on ordinary European consumers consumers because it is obviously the one The only way you can see when you are Europeans in relation to the green transition The truth is that you are on your way so far in front of the world community that the only thing you do is regulate and tax jobs, prosperity and growth out of Europe Out to the rest of the world It is incredibly so little thought out of the green policy is in the EU If you really want to save the world, if you really believe that green transition is a necessity, then the only way we can actually change something is , through innovation, through the market forces and through the fact that we stop believing that we can ""pick the winner"" here in the European Parliament for the truth is that it is not going very well","- HR chairman!

163059,"- Mr. President, dear Biljana, Mr. Commissioner, this text, which aims to empower consumers in the Green Transition, is part of a series of important texts, as colleagues have already said and who are still discussed in Parliament, I think of sustainable textile eco -design, repairability, green allegations These future directives do not deal directly with the same subject, but have a common objective: allow European citizens to be actors in the ecological transition and thus consume in a lit manner While, as we know, the ecological urgency is before us the text that we will vote tomorrow is certainly not perfect. For what? Because we are dealing with early obsolescence without truly ending the planned obsolescence which does so much damage to the faces of our fellow citizens. The misleading interfaces are often not very targeted. So obviously, there is still work and that is why we must continue to work to strengthen the rights and the protection of consumer. Now we must act that this directive, despite everything, is an essential advance and we must support it. It better regulates targeted advertisements of an ecological nature. Repairability becomes normality. Recyclability and sustainability become information given to consumers for an informed choice. As we know, some obstacles, especially on spare parts, remain on the profession. But this text strengthens the requirements. Obviously, companies will have to play the game by applying affordable prices and indicating the availability of spare parts at the time of purchase. In my opinion, this is the substantial marrow of this text. And in this spirit, the European Union must show an example in the face of the challenges. Our fellow citizens expect a lot from us, and rightly. Confidence in Brussels is largely eroded, in many. So let's work together on the rights of our fellow citizens and do not open the mouth simply to yawn but to advance the issues.","- Mr. President, dear Biljana, Mr. Commissioner, this text, which aims to empower consumers in the Green Transition, is part of a series of important texts, as colleagues have already said and who are still discussed in Parliament, I think of sustainable textile eco -design, repairability, green allegations These future directives do not deal directly with the same subject, but have a common objective: allow European citizens to be actors in the ecological transition and thus consume in a lit manner While, as we know, the ecological urgency is before us the text that we will vote tomorrow is certainly not perfect.
