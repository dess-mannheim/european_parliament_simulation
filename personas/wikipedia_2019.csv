He is a member of the Together for Catalonia party and has been associated with the pro-independence faction of the Democratic Convergence of Catalonia party.

He has been a Member of the European Parliament since 2019. He is married to Romanian journalist Marcela Topor and has two daughters.

He has also been critical of the European Union's handling of the Catalan crisis and has called for reforms to the EU to make it more democratic and responsive to the needs of its citizens.

Puigdemont has been involved in several controversies throughout his career, including his role in the 2017 Catalan independence referendum and his subsequent removal from office. He has also been accused of misusing public funds and has been the subject of several investigations and lawsuits. Despite these challenges, he remains a prominent figure in Catalan politics and continues to advocate for the region's right to self-determination.

 Puigdemont was elected as a Member of the European Parliament in 2019, but was initially unable to take his seat due to a Spanish court ruling. He eventually took his seat in January 2020 and has been an active member of the parliament, advocating for Catalan interests and pushing for reforms to the EU.

He has been a vocal critic of the Spanish government's actions in Catalonia and has called for the EU to take a more active role in resolving the crisis. He has also been a strong advocate for the rights of Catalan citizens and has worked to promote the region's culture and interests.

In 2021, Puigdemont was arrested in Italy on a European arrest warrant issued by Spain, but was released without charge. He has also been the subject of several other investigations and lawsuits, including a Spanish Supreme Court investigation into his role in the 2017 Catalan independence referendum.

 Puigdemont has been a strong advocate for the rights of Catalan citizens and has worked to promote the region's culture and interests. He has been a vocal critic of the Spanish government's actions in Catalonia and has called for the EU to take a more active role in resolving the crisis. Despite the challenges he has faced, he remains a prominent figure in Catalan politics and continues to advocate for the region's right to self-determination.

 Puigdemont has pointed out the fact that Spain has decided to recognize Palestine but not Kosovo, ""a country with which the European Union has diplomatic relations"". He also accused Spain of helping Turkey ""to suppress the Kurds"". Puigdemont said that ""Above all, Spain is the country that suppressed the democratic referendum of Catalonia"" on 1 October 2017.

On 8 August 2024, Puigdemont made a return to Spain after seven years in self-imposed exile in Belgium, delivering a defiant speech at the Arc de Triomf in Barcelona advocating for Catalonia's right to self-determination before quickly disappearing, sparking a large-scale police operation."
